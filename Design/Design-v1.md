    -   The lower half of the camper cannot be wider than this! And
        > should be smaller to make loading easier.
-   Length without tonneau cover bar: 95-3/8\" min
    -   NOTE: SMALLER than rated floor length of 97.6\"
-   Bed to Cab Roof height: 40.4\" or 3.37\'
-   Wheel well height: 10"

### Windshield

-   slope is \~37 degrees

-   rear of cab to beginning of windshield is (minimum) 34 inches

-   angle from flat line on top of the truck to windshield: \~ 143.692
    > degrees

## Camper Dimensions
### Outside

-   Foam shell
    -   Floor
        -   area 1: 48" x 92" x 2"
    -   Bottom-most wall
        -   Width: 48"
            -   If I want it to fit into a Toyota Tundra it needs to be
                > less than 48.7"; all other half-tons have 50" or more
            -   A sheet of XPS is 48" wide max, so this is easiest to
                > work with unless I want to stitch together bigger
                > pieces just to gain an extra inch of floor space
        -   Length: 92"
        -   Height: 12"
    -   Lower Left Wall
        -   tailgate to wheel well:
            -   Length: 23"
    -   Bottom tailgate to wheel well section
        -   Width:
        -   Height: 10"
    -   Middle
        -   Width: 58"
        -   Length: 92"
        -   Height: 22.5" ( ((22.5-12)+2) = 12.5 )

        -   Width: 78"
        -   Length: 92"
        -   Height: 83" ( 83-22.5 = 60.5 )
    -   Cabover
        -   Bottom wall exterior height: 42.5"
            -   The bed to cab is 40.4", so this gives approx 2", which
                > will be reduced by the plywood and PMF
        -   Bottom wall interior height: 44.5"
            -   The foam of the cabover floor is 2"

### Inside

## Vehicle Tie-downs

-   Some people use the internal truck bed mount points to tie down the
    > slide-in
-   Some people use external mounts that attach to the bottom of the
    > truck bed
    -   [*https://www.etrailer.com/dept-pg-Truck_Camper_Tie_Downs.aspx*](https://www.etrailer.com/dept-pg-Truck_Camper_Tie_Downs.aspx)
-   Remember that the anchor points on the truck camper MUST be inward
    > towards the middle of the camper, and the mount points on the
    > truck must be toward the outside. This allows the attachment
    > points to pull the camper in opposite directions, strengthening
    > the connection and keeping the camper more stable.
-   [*https://www.etrailer.com/faq-install-camper.aspx*](https://www.etrailer.com/faq-install-camper.aspx)
-   A lower attachment point (the frame) distributes weight better
-   **Location of tie down points on camper relative to the truck
    > mounting points is critical to stability
    > (**[***https://www.etrailer.com/Merchant2/graphics/00000001/pics/t/i/tiedown-placement_2_500.jpg***](https://www.etrailer.com/Merchant2/graphics/00000001/pics/t/i/tiedown-placement_2_500.jpg)**)**

## Camper Jacks

-   PRO TIP: Make sure to also raise the front of the camper first -
    > then raise the back to bring it level. If you raise the rear
    > first, there is a chance that the camper could tip forward due to
    > it having more weight in the front because of the weight of the
    > overhang.

-   [*https://torkliftcentral.com/camper-bumper-kit-a7001*](https://torkliftcentral.com/camper-bumper-kit-a7001)

## Rubber Pad

-   Put down a rubber pad in the bed. It should be fairly thick (around 3/8" or bigger) and solid rubber, to absorb impact/reduce bouncing, and prevent sliding. Also raises camper, so that it's not too close to the cab or bed.

## Water

-   [*https://faroutride.com/water-system/*](https://faroutride.com/water-system/)

### Storage

Need two water containers:

-   Clean water
    -   For shower, cleaning dishes/hands, drinking water, cooking water
-   Gray water
    -   For storing spent dirty water from shower, cleaning dishes/hands
    -   Smaller than clean water tank

Containers can be kept in two places:

1.  Stored inside the camper
    a.  Some kind of container in a hidden compartment in the camper.
        > Typically there\'s also a water level indicator.
    b.  This has the benefit of not needing insulation in the winter.
        > The thermal load of the ambient temperature water also helps
        > regulate temperature inside the camper.
2.  Stored outside the camper
    a.  Typically you\'d have a black water, grey water, and clean water
        > tank in a storage compartment under the truck, like in a
        > fender area, suspended by a metal shelf.
    b.  May need insulation in winter to keep container from freezing.
        > This adds load to your energy requirements

Since this camper is going on a purpose built truck (flat bed), the
water can be stored as either of the two above.

For expediency, we will start with a small water container in a
compartment in the camper. Later on we can relocate it to the exterior
and use the interior space for storage. **Note: all plumbing for future
uses must still be installed regardless of option.**



# Plumbing

External plumbing:

-   A port for receiving clean water from shore

-   A port to empty the gray water tank

# Heated water

# Notes

-   Must vent exhaust of propane water heater to outside (as per law)

-   May want a separate air intake vent

-   Some people will take a waterproof plastic box (??) embed it in
    > outside of camper and install the heater in it

# Power calculations

-   Amps = Watts ÷ Volts

-   Watts = Amps x Volts

-   Amp-hours = Can draw N Amps for an hour

-   Power draw:

    -   700w @ 120vAC = 5.83 amps

    -   750w @ 120vAC = 6.25 amps

    -   900w @ 120vAC = 7.5 amps

    -   1200w @ 120vAC = 10 amps

    -   1500w @ 120vAC = 12.5 amps

    -   1800w @ 120vAC = 15 amps

    -   2000w @ 120vAC = 16.67 amps

    -   2640w @ 120vAC = 22 amps

    -   3000w @ 120vAC = 25 amps

-   Examples:

    -   For 6.25 amps, for a 400Ah battery (assume 90% inverter
        > efficiency reduces it to 360Ah),\
        > 360 / 6.25 = 57.6 hours

-   Notes

    -   If the electric device claims way more amps than makes sense for
        > the wattage/voltage,\
        > It's because the power supply is very inefficient (which
        > sucks)

    -   Get a slow-start adapter for ACs/fridges so the initial peak
        > pull isn't too much

# Toilet

# Ventilation

-   [*https://faroutride.com/condensation-moisture-van/*](https://faroutride.com/condensation-moisture-van/)

# Windows

-   Make sure to use double-pane windows (even if they cost more) to
    > make the most of air conditioner and heater. Windows lose a ton of
    > energy, the bigger they are the more they lose.
