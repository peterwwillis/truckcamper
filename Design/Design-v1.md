    -   [*https://www.etrailer.com/dept-pg-Truck_Camper_Tie_Downs.aspx*](https://www.etrailer.com/dept-pg-Truck_Camper_Tie_Downs.aspx)

-   Remember that the anchor points on the truck camper MUST be inward
    > towards the middle of the camper, and the mount points on the
    > truck must be toward the outside. This allows the attachment
    > points to pull the camper in opposite directions, strengthening
    > the connection and keeping the camper more stable.

-   [*https://www.etrailer.com/faq-install-camper.aspx*](https://www.etrailer.com/faq-install-camper.aspx)

-   A lower attachment point (the frame) distributes weight better

[]{#anchor-16}Water

-   [*https://faroutride.com/water-system/*](https://faroutride.com/water-system/)

[]{#anchor-17}Storage

Need two water containers:

-   Clean water

    -   For shower, cleaning dishes/hands, drinking water, cooking water

-   Gray water

    -   For storing spent dirty water from shower, cleaning dishes/hands

    -   Smaller than clean water tank

Containers can be kept in two places:

1.  Stored inside the camper

    a.  Some kind of container in a hidden compartment in the camper.
        > Typically there\'s also a water level indicator.

    b.  This has the benefit of not needing insulation in the winter.
        > The thermal load of the ambient temperature water also helps
        > regulate temperature inside the camper.

2.  Stored outside the camper

    a.  Typically you\'d have a black water, grey water, and clean water
        > tank in a storage compartment under the truck, like in a
        > fender area, suspended by a metal shelf.

    b.  May need insulation in winter to keep container from freezing.
        > This adds load to your energy requirements

Since this camper is going on a purpose built truck (flat bed), the
water can be stored as either of the two above.

For expediency, we will start with a small water container in a
compartment in the camper. Later on we can relocate it to the exterior
and use the interior space for storage. **Note: all plumbing for future
uses must still be installed regardless of option.**

**Polyethylene camper van water tanks must be vented. **These fresh
water tanks are not designed to handle pressure or a vacuum. A vent is
necessary because as the tank is filled or emptied of its liquid an
equal proportion of air must be displaced simultaneously. Discharge of a
water tank without a vent would cause a vacuum to occur. A generally
accepted rule concerning vent size is that it should be the same size as
the tank's largest outlet.

**If using a translucent tank for fresh water, consider applying paint
to make the tank opaque to prevent algae formation due to exposure to
light.**

**Use thin elastomeric (not foam) strips on the tank to reduce vibration
and wear and create a tight fit.**

[]{#anchor-18}Plumbing

External plumbing:

-   A port for receiving clean water from shore

-   A port to empty the gray water tank

[]{#anchor-19}Heated water

[]{#anchor-20}Notes

-   Must vent exhaust of propane water heater to outside (as per law)

-   May want a separate air intake vent

-   Some people will take a waterproof plastic box (??) embed it in
    > outside of camper and install the heater in it

[]{#anchor-28}Power calculations

-   Amps = Watts ÷ Volts

-   Watts = Amps x Volts

-   Amp-hours = Can draw N Amps for an hour

-   Power draw:

    -   700w @ 120vAC = 5.83 amps

    -   750w @ 120vAC = 6.25 amps

    -   900w @ 120vAC = 7.5 amps

    -   1200w @ 120vAC = 10 amps

    -   1500w @ 120vAC = 12.5 amps

    -   1800w @ 120vAC = 15 amps

    -   2000w @ 120vAC = 16.67 amps

    -   2640w @ 120vAC = 22 amps

    -   3000w @ 120vAC = 25 amps

-   Examples:

    -   For 6.25 amps, for a 400Ah battery (assume 90% inverter
        > efficiency reduces it to 360Ah),\
        > 360 / 6.25 = 57.6 hours

-   Notes

    -   If the electric device claims way more amps than makes sense for
        > the wattage/voltage,\
        > It's because the power supply is very inefficient (which
        > sucks)

    -   Get a slow-start adapter for ACs/fridges so the initial peak
        > pull isn't too much
