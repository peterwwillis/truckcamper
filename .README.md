Build process:

1. Install `make`, `csv2md`
2. Run `make`
   1. A script `convert_templates.sh` runs that will find files matching '\*.tmpl.md', and passes them to `inject_text.sh`
   2. A script `inject_text.sh` takes a list of files, and for each file, opens the file,
      prints the file until it reaches `__START_EMBED_CONTENT__`, then reads into a buffer until `__END_EMBED_CONTENT__`, and executes the buffer in the shell, and takes the output and outputs that, then continues printing out the file contents.
