# truckcamper / Models


## About

This directory contains 3D models of the truck camper (and associated stuff).


These designs are implemented using [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/) (originally using version 0.21, now using 1.0).

I have never used CAD software before and I still haven't taken the time to learn it properly, so please excuse the crappiness of my work.
