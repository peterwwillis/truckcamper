# truckcamper


## About

I'm making a DIY truck camper. I wanted to share some of the materials and research I've discovered along the way to make the process easier for other people who want to do the same.

## Models

Check out the [3D Models](./Models) I've made or used to help design the truck camper.

## Design

I have some general [design notes](./Design/) about the camper.

## Research

I have tried to document my [Research materials](./Research/). There's a lot of stuff here, including materials research, construction ideas, etc.

## Trucks

The truck you put your truck camper on matters quite a bit. I've put some information [on Trucks here](./Trucks/).
