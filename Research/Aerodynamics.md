## Aerodynamics

-   The "teardrop" or "duck tail" shape is the most aerodynamically efficient.

-   There isn't a ton of mpg savings to be had in aerodynamics, so don't go crazy with it
-   General rules of thumb
    -   #1. Reduce your overall frontal area. Look at a picture of the front of the vehicle. If it's big, that's going to affect air resistance the most.
    -   #2. Radius the corners (especially in front) at least 6â€³. This will allow the air to flow over the corners without separating.
    -   #3. Allow a 7% transition to keep airflow attached
    -   #4. Eliminate as many protuberances as possible. (that includes even a 1 inch difference from outer skin to windows -- which is why so many newer cars have flush fitting glass)

    -   "The only proven use of vortex generators is to create better flow attachment."
