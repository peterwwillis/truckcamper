# Research / Reminders

-   Estimate weight and check wet weight capacity of vehicle

-   Check marine stores for RV parts

-   Gut an old RV to get cheap parts (windows, cabinets, fridge, heater, jacks, door, stairs, water tanks)

-   Insulation can be held to top of camper with some cloth

-   Use rot-resistant materials anywhere possible, water is what destroys RVs

-   With wet bath, needs to drain no matter what incline you're on

-   If you end up with a crew cab you can use it for storage and build a pass-through

-   If you have a toilet and no sink where the toilet is, your kitchen sink is now your bathroom sink too

-   Install electrical (lights, 12V/110V, appliances, pumps) and plumbing before finishing insulation and interior upholstery/flooring

-   Consider thickness of walls before installing windows

-   Teardrop shaped over-cab can help aerodynamics

-   Don't run data and electrical lines in parallel

-   Run some 110V lines as well as 12V so you can charge some accessory AC-powered devices

-   Consider external ports for water and electrical for hookups at RV parks

-   Consider the roof placement for solar panels, Starlink, and a hatch+fan for ventilation

-   Upper cabinets contribute to top-heavy; keep the top light

-   Consider how you'll install lift jacks, tie-down points

-   Make the roof curved upward to make rain fall off it

-   You may need a breaker box as a junction for external, internal power

-   Plumbing needs to drain downward

-   Remember to mark where studs, lines are for later installing stuff

-   If there is thermal bridging, water will form on the interior and bead down. Supposedly honeycomb panels provide no insulation, a solid frame creates a thermal bridge.  [*https://totalcomposites.com/composite-panels-debunked/*](https://totalcomposites.com/composite-panels-debunked/)

-   Remember a fire extinguisher and think about how to put out a fire quickly

-   Fire-proofing upholstery

-   Frame mounts reduce body roll

-   "Because it comes out 6" over the end of the truck bed it has its own rear lights" ([*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNoplsCcZMA*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNoplsCcZMA))

-   Batteries might not charge if not warm enough. Might want to ventilate battery box

-   Keep water tanks in camper so no need to winterize them

-   During winter, if you run your heater and kill your propane tank, you gotta go outside to change out the propane tanks

-   Single-pane windows will get condensation and then freeze solid in winter

-   Think about where icicles may form, snow may accumulate

-   Try to figure out how much it affects vehicle when you add weight to left or right of top of vehicle

-   The width of the camper can be within the width of the mirrors 96.8\")

-   Remember to winter prep both the water tanks, houses, and propane

-   Remember a temperature sensor and hygrometer

-   Think about how to vent the camper

-   100amp fuse boxes with breakers for all power needs (breaker box)

-   Figure out best way to hook up charging from the truck into the internal battery

-   Internal battery will need to be charged by shore power, car, and solar

-   Will want both internal and external access to 12V DC, 115V AC, and USB including fast charging

-   Will want to consider a large DC AC inverter that will run off the internal battery

-   Should have switches to shut off all nonessential electronics to save battery, in addition to fuse box

-   Remember a fire extinguisher

-   Will want both inlet and outlet for clean and gray water. Place outlets where they can drain easily

-   Splash some gray water treatment into the sink after you empty the gray water tank

-   Keep a bucket in the truck for emptying gray water

-   Condensation will build up on interior surfaces sometimes, keep in mind

-   Interior compartments that don\'t have ventilation will be prone to mold

-   A fan circulating air will probably be critical to proper humidity control in the absence of a heater, dehumidifier, or air conditioner

-   Another option for interior compartment humidity control is silica gel or similar

-   Soft top Pop-ups have a lot of issues

    -   Blocking windows

    -   Closing unit can be finicky when soft top doesn\'t move in properly or items in the camper gets in the way

    -   Ice and snow can build up on the exterior making closing the camper not work right

    -   Less insulation

    -   Sun probably will fade the soft windows

-   \"I have a ARE DCU (topper) on my Ram 2500. I also had one on my previous F350. I love them for working out of. I\'ve also insulated and paneled my current one so it makes a pretty decent camper too. But they definitely don\'t hold up well to twisting forest roads. They flex too much and it cracks the aluminum right next to the welds. And I\'m not talking about rough four wheeling, just the normal driving up rutted forest roads that we all do.\"

-   \"when you weld aluminum, over time it stress fractures at the end of the weld. that is why airplanes are bolted and riveted together, not welded.\"

-   If you park anywhere not secure, and stuff is attached to the outside, it will be stolen

-   Steel skid plates are heavy (180-250lbs!) but the lower center of gravity weight can help stability

-   Aluminum roof is very loud in rain; maybe add high density vinyl panels

-   Think again about each season and location the truck will be in for design requirements

    -   Adirondacks in Winter

        -   -18F temps for 2 weeks

        -   How to make sure the water doesn't freeze?

            -   If external tanks, needs insulation and warming wire.

            -   What kind of power requirement is that? Will solar be available?

-   Plastic windows are lighter and cheaper but will probably fade at some point or get scratched

-   Whatever propane accessories you have plumbed inside, need to stay inside. Otherwise you have to shut off the main propane valve, remove the interior propane thing, vent the propane, etc. So a mr buddy heater inside that comes out for camping may be a no-go.

-   Swing-arm tables are floppy, fixed tables are not

-   Pop-up canopies will eventually weather and leak

-   Make it so you can stay inside the truck to do whatever you need if it's raining, snowing, hot, dust storm, etc

-   Minimize weight in the construction on the top to lessen top-heaviness

-   Think about how hard it\'s gonna be to back the truck under the camper on jacks. The tighter the fit, the harder it\'ll be to line up

-   The camper body may actually need to flex and move independent of the bed, so it might need extra space in bed to move around

-   Think about tie down points

-   Look up bridge heights because you may end up on Google directions where you have to go under a bridge which has a minimum height

-   "Over the past five years, a lot of companies started using a honeycomb core with fiberglass on either side. The resulting panel is incredibly strong, but there's virtually no insulation in a honeycomb panel. Our solid polyurethane panels provide exceptional insulation. When you're camping in the heat of summer or the cold of winter, you will definitely feel a difference. Honeycomb panels are also about a third heavier than foam core panels."

-   "I used epoxy resin with chop strand fiberglass (Polyester resin melts the foam)"

-   Tire rolling resistance affects fuel economy

-   You can increase truck payload capacity sometimes.  ([*https://www.truckcamperadventure.com/raising-your-trucks-payload/*](https://www.truckcamperadventure.com/raising-your-trucks-payload/)) ([*https://truckfitters.com/guide-payload-capacity/*](https://truckfitters.com/guide-payload-capacity/)) ([*https://www.torklift.com/blog/entry/how-to-increase-my-trucks-payload*](https://www.torklift.com/blog/entry/how-to-increase-my-trucks-payload))

-   You can get a tax credit for buying insulation ([*https://www.energystar.gov/about/federal-tax-credits/insulation*](https://www.energystar.gov/about/federal-tax-credits/insulation))

-   RV safety codes require window blinds/windows not be within so many inches of a cooktop

-   How will you carry firewood??

-   If installing a fuel pump for diesel/gas heater, it may need to be at a 15 to 35 degree angle

-   Gas/Diesel heaters can get carbon build up at elevation and stop working

    -   Maintenance: Run on hot for 30 minutes every month, replace fuel filter every year, check for condensation in exhaust hose and clean out ([*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPxKLERKCo0*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPxKLERKCo0))

-   For the gray water tank: might contain food scraps! Will need to clean out the gray water tank regularly

-   If it's hot outside, maybe be able to move the cook stove outside, so you don't heat up the camper

-   During construction, to make sure the whole box is straight/level/etc, measure diagonally, check a level, square, etc.

-   One 8ft piece of XPS at the rear goes from floor to ceiling, and the sides are made from a different piece and notched/glued together

-   TotalBoat has an epoxy fairing compound used to fill gaps and then sand down to a flush surface before fiberglassing/painting

-   Reasons for a fan

    -   Hot nights

    -   Cooking

    -   Leaving the camper

-   Make sure that any external switches or electrical are IP-rated so they don't make sparks (safe to use around propane bottles)
