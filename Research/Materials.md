## Shell


### Metal

#### Steel

- Flashing
  - Used to help keep water out of houses, this is thin metal sheets bent at a 90-degree angle. Could be really useful to reinforce corners in my build, or to protect door/window?

- Notes
  - Used in some camper shells as "corner caps" in stainless steel

### Fiberglass

- See Plastic above for FRP

- Tips
  - **Do not use polyester or vinyl ester resin on Styrofoam.** The styrene in the polyester or vinyl ester resin will melt it. Epoxy resin should be used.
  - One of the most important steps when working with fiberglass is surface preparation. Your surface must be clean and dry. The surface needs to be free of contaminates such as dust, existing paint, grease, oil etc. You can prepare your surface by sanding with a coarse sand paper and power sander. It can be time consuming but well worth it. Clean the surface with acetone to remove dust or grease.
  - Use metal screws and silicone sealant if fastening into fiberglass. ([*https://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f55/screwing-into-fiberglass-185876.html*](https://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f55/screwing-into-fiberglass-185876.html))

- Fiberglass
  - Some kinds (ex. Filon) are specially designed for RVs. I think they're more UV resistant? ([*https://www.recpro.com/rv-fiberglass-filon-siding-8-5-wide-arctic-white/*](https://www.recpro.com/rv-fiberglass-filon-siding-8-5-wide-arctic-white/))
  - Advertised as more durable than aluminum

- Composite Fiberglass
  - [*https://www.westsystem.com/instruction/epoxy-basics/applying-fiberglass-cloth-tape-2/estimating-epoxy-coverage-for-fabric-application/*](https://www.westsystem.com/instruction/epoxy-basics/applying-fiberglass-cloth-tape-2/estimating-epoxy-coverage-for-fabric-application/)

- [*Fiberglass cloth*](https://sales-947.myshopify.com/collections/fiberglass-cloth), also known as fiberglass fabric
  - low in weight and becomes strong when combined with resin. It works well for building composite parts, making molds and for fiberglass repairs. The lower weight fabrics are great for waterproofing. It becomes transparent when resin is added. The heavier fabrics are stronger and build up thickness quicker.
  - The 6, 7.5 and 10 ounce plain weave fabrics are the most commonly used. They have a simple plain weave pattern that is uniform in strength both horizontally and vertically. This pattern has warp and fill yarns that are interlaced over and under each other in alternating fashion. The plain weave is the easiest to handle since it does not unravel as much as the other weaves when cut.
  - Most fabrics are sold by the yard and come in 38", 50" and 60" widths. There is also the option of [*fiberglass tape*](https://sales-947.myshopify.com/collections/fiberglass-tape). The widths on these range from 1" to 12" and come in 50 yard rolls. Fiberglass tape has selvage edges to keep it from un-raveling and do not have an adhesive backing. They are used  with resin just like the regular fabrics.

- [*Chopped strand mat*](https://sales-947.myshopify.com/collections/chopped-strand-mat) is also known as fiberglass mat.
  - It is made up of short strands of fibers that are randomly oriented and held together with a resin binder. The resin binder needs styrene to dissolve properly. This makes it incompatible with epoxy resin. It is **only compatible with polyester and vinyl ester resin **which contains styrene. When polyester or vinyl ester resin is added to the mat, the binder dissolves and the fibers can be moved around. This makes it easy to conform to tight curves and corners.

  - Chopped strand mat is the most affordable fiberglass and is frequently used in mold construction or projects where thickness is needed. It is meant for non-structural application as it does not have much strength. If you need strength you should choose a woven cloth or you could mix the two. Mat can be used between layers of woven fabric to help build thickness quickly and to aid in all layers bonding well together.

  - Mat is also often used as the first layer, right before the [*gelcoat*](https://sales-947.myshopify.com/collections/gelcoats), in a laminate to hide print through from heavier fabrics. Print through is when the fabric weave texture shows through the resin. Mat is also easy to handle and can be torn instead of cut.

### Poor man's fiberglass (PMF)

-   Glue or paint applied to cloth on top of foam (or some other material). A crappy version of composite fiberglass (epoxy applied to a fiberglass on top of something else).

-   Glue tends to be Titebond II or III.

    -   Titebond III has the highest strength and best water proofing of the 3 wood glue grades of Titebond. PVA glues also don't require as long a clamping time as polyurethane glues and doesn't foam/expand. ([*http://titebond.com/App_Static/literature/glues/FF681_TBIIIUltimateBrochureTB.pdf*](http://titebond.com/App_Static/literature/glues/FF681_TBIIIUltimateBrochureTB.pdf))
        -   Weighs 9.22lbs/gallon
        -   Tensile strength 4000 psi
        -   Open time of 8-10 minutes

    -   ("waterproof wood glue (Titebond II) instead of epoxy for the layer between substrate and fabric, then any natural fiber fabric instead of fiberglass, then exterior acrylic paint on top")

    -   Some people use Gorilla Glue instead of Titebond
        -   ([*https://ncwoodworker.net/forums/index.php?threads/poor-mans-fibreglas.77679/*](https://ncwoodworker.net/forums/index.php?threads/poor-mans-fibreglas.77679/))
        -   Gorilla glue is ridiculous expensive (right now). Epoxy is as cheap/cheaper.

-   This has been used by lots of people to build teardrop campers, kayaks, etc, using just XPS foam and poor man's fiberglass. Apparently they hold up well over time.

    -   Sometimes they're using plywood on the inside, which could be a significant part of the strength.

    -   It does protect and strengthen plain XPS foam, based on unscientific tests on youtube. But there's no scientific tests to judge exactly how much.

-   The "science" behind it:

    -   XPS foam has weak tensile and shear strength.

    -   A cloth glued to the foam provides tensile/shear strength as the whole thing works as a composite.

    -   Basically if it can't stretch or bend the fabric, the foam won't bend or stretch either.

-   Application tips:

    -   Wash the canvas first before applying glue.

    -   Sand the XPS first, and maybe put some small holes in, before applying glue.

        -   "The rest of the body was pretty much the same system. Paint body with TBII, paint backside of canvas with TBII, unroll canvas, mist canvas with water, smooth out canvas, paint body with TBII, paint backside of canvas with TBII, unroll canvas, mist canvas with water, smooth out canvas, ect. I camped the canvas at the door opening so I did not have to worry about working around a clamp."

        -   "A water bottle and a small roller are real handy with the canvasing process. I used the water to keep the canvas damp and the roller to push the canvas into the TBII and smooth everything out."

        -   "In case anyone is wondering, I am using the Harbor Freight canvas drop cloth for the fabric. They sell a 12x9 Foot drop cloth and in my case was just barely enough to cover the entire body without a seam. I even had to cut the edge seems open so I could have enough to wrap around the top and ends. The area I was covering was 8\'2\", but I believe the canvas did shrink some. I had watered down the canvas down the night before to get some of the bad wrinkles out prior to gluing. I had to do a bit of pulling near the bottom to get the canvas to stretch enough to cover into the hatch area. I think that on the other side I am going to try to glue without pre-wetting the canvas.  The bad wrinkles that were still present seemed to smooth out fine with some extra water and working them with the roller. I had absolutely no shrinking of the canvas once applied on this side though."

        -   "I bought two canvas drop cloths and found this one to be nice and uniform. There is a seam near half way on the long length, but did not pose a problem for me for this build. I will be able to do the other side of the trailer without the seam getting in the way. Two 8\'2\" by 4\'2.5\" walls for the price of \$14.99 with some extra left over is not bad."

        -   "I did not try to fold or cut any canvas that was coated with full strength TBII. I diluted the TBII 3 to 1. I also misted the canvas with water where I knew I would be cutting before applying the TBII mixture. The canvas was still pretty stiff. After cutting I sprayed water on the canvas again before the final application of full strength TBII coating to the edge. This seemed to help soften up the canvas so that it could move around enough to lay flat. I just had to work it some with the roller, but eventually it smoothed out. It really was not too difficult."

        -   (later)

        -   "I have found with my second build that the corners are quite solid if you use liberal full strength TBII in the corner edging. By not adding flashing to the body before canvasing it saves time and effort by not having to fair in the flashing with spackle. If done right I think it will look just fine on the outside and can be used only in areas that many have a need for more protection."

        -   "Expansion rate of foam needs to be addressed. Foam tends to have a high expansion rate compared to other materials in the build. In most cases in this build it is just cosmetic. The biggest problem I have is the drivers side door. I made my measurements for door size in the morning and allowed 1/4\" clearance. I installed the door in the morning a few days later and all was good. Then I tried to open the door in the afternoon and the door was hitting the frame. Passenger side door is fine, but I remembered I made my measurements in the afternoon on that side when the foam had already heated up. This was my first indication of the expansion issue. I then noticed where I had to spliced the flashing on roof it was buckling and causing the canvas to buldge out when cold, it is fine when hot. Next was the front wall. Near the bottom, where the floor has another expansion rate, it tends to show the glue line between the side walls and the front wall. Since the side walls cant flex due to being glued to the floor the expansion and contraction of the front wall is noticeable along the front lower portion of the walls.  This problem will probably be noticeable on most builds.  To hide this on my second build I rapped the corners 2\".  This puts the corner cut line right on the foam to foam glue line and disguises any expansion issues."

        -   He seems to have used XPS for shelves with flashing to protect the edges ([*https://www.tnttt.com/viewtopic.php?f=55&t=60303*](https://www.tnttt.com/viewtopic.php?f=55&t=60303))

        -   "Ok a little test this weekend does show that indeed TBII bonds to Gripper. In fact, I think this combo may be a better bond than just using TBII to foam. It seems the gripper bonds better to the foam than TBII and TBII bonds real well to Gripper\...." / "So I had a piece of foam that was coated with Gripper on one side and was bare foam on the other. I took some painters paper and glued it to both sides of the foam. Once dried I tried to peal the paper off of the foam that just had TBII applied. I was able to easily get my fingernail under the paper and pull it away from the foam." / "Now for the side with Gripper.  I had a hard time getting ahold of the paper with my fingernail. Once I did get ahold of it, it was hard to try and get the paper to peel up and would tear. As you can see the TBII and Gripper bond never failed. You can see where I had to gouge into the foam to try and get the paper to lift up." / "Finally I was able to get a good grip on the paper and was able to carefully pull the paper back. It was harder to pull back than with just the TBII and paper. So this makes be a believer that the Gripper is a viable medium to apply before the application of TBII for a good bond to dissimilar materials."

        -   "My choice for skinning is TBII 50/50. I have applied canvas with this mix over bare foam, painted foam, primed foam.  It sticks! After that I paint over it with another coat of TBII 50/50 to fill the canvas weave totally. Then I give it a sanding to knock of the high points then a coat of primer and then 2 coats of latex paint. It works! The beauty of this is that if you do have a failure, delamination or bubbles (I have fixed both), it is a easy fix. TBII 50/50 and a small needle syringe and you fixed up and ready to go in no time. It works."

        -   " I don\'t, however, use paint/primer to attach canvas.  Tight Bond II, usually diluted 50/50 is what I use. I first sand the foam with a light grit paper and then wipe down the foam with alcohol. I then apply the bonding primer before laying the canvas. I have found that the primer bonds better to the foam and the TBII bonds great to the primer."

        -   "You only put glue between the canvas and the surface, not over the canvas again. You use exterior grade paint on the outside of the canvas. I did mine onto foam with Titebond 2 glue. Once that was dry we applied a 50/50 mix of exterior paint and water for the first coat. Second coat was 75/25 paint/water and the third coat was 100% exterior paint. I followed advice from TnTT.com forum and The L Wood by Lucy on YouTube for how to apply it(link below).  One thing to watch out for is many people use cotton canvas drop clothes but those should be washed first to remove some of the excess fuzz. I bought an 8' wide roll of cotton duck cloth for mine and had no issues applying it straight off the roll. I even had to trim back some of the canvas on my windows opening and had a hard time getting it to separate from the wood."

-   Repair tips:

    -   Supposedly if you dent the foam or it delaminates, you can put a cloth down over the PMF and heat it with an iron, and the glue will become liquid again, and the foam may return to its original shape.

-   Typical problems:

    -   bubbles forming under the fabric due to moisture or offgassing

-   Other fabrics:

    -   fiberglass screen, metal screen, landscaping fabric, roof repair fabric

    -   Only seen one person on YouTube use metal screen. He mentioned also using fiberglass, which yeah fiberglass is gonna make it really strong, but I guess the paint is a decent enough bond compared to epoxy which is more expensive.

    -   In theory this could be stronger than fabric, but that probably depends on the fabric, testing needed. The metal screen will probably resist impacts better than cloth.

    -   Not sure if cheaper than fabric.

    -   More paint is needed for PMF than PMMF. probably has some effect on the result, not sure.

### Adhesives

#### Tapes

-   VHB tape

    -   Suitable for metals, other surfaces

    -   "The \[1/16th aluminum\] panels are secured to the camper with a VHB (Very High Bond) acrylic mounting tape made by 3M that is designed for mounting panels to a frame. The VHB is such a strong fastener, that it is actually reinforcing the welds while dampening vibrations and impact that the camper takes when driving off road. On top of this, it seals out all water and requires zero holes unlike rivets. It is able to last 30+ years. Watch this video if you're not convinced: VHB Strength Demonstration . The camper is then double sealed with some of the best marine grade sealants that are UV stable." ([*https://www.radicaproducts.com/moonlander*](https://www.radicaproducts.com/moonlander))

#### Resins

-   Resin has a short shelf life. Try to store the resin in a cool dry place, or refrigerate (do not freeze) it to extend the life of the resin.

-   [*Polyester*](https://sales-947.myshopify.com/collections/polyester-resin) resin

    -    It is the easiest to use when compared to vinyl ester and epoxy resin. It is also the most economical. Polyester resin has a quick cure and adds dimensional stability. It has many different uses and is often used in building/repairing boats, car bodies, patio decks, surfboards, kayaks, decorative surfaces, outdoor ponds, bath tubs, plus more. **If you will be finishing with a gel coat, it is important to use either polyester or vinyl ester resin as your laminating resin. Gel coats are polyester resins and will not adhere well if epoxy resin is used first.**

    -   There are several grades of polyester resins including ISO (isophthalic) and Ortho (orthophthalic). The most popular is the [***Ortho***](https://fiberglasswarehouse.com/collections/polyester-resin/products/ortho-general-purpose-polyester-resin)[* General Purpose Laminating Resin*](https://fiberglasswarehouse.com/collections/polyester-resin/products/ortho-general-purpose-polyester-resin), but ISO is better. Surfboard resin is also better.

-   [*Vinyl ester resin*](https://sales-947.myshopify.com/collections/vinylester-resin)

    -   falls between the polyester and epoxy resin when it comes to different characteristics and cost. It has a longer molecular chain than polyester resin which helps it absorb impact better than polyester and it shrinks less. There is also less chance of de-lamination when using VE resin. Vinyl ester can be used as a final coat after polyester resin to create a better water barrier.

    -   Vinyl Ester resin is also more resistant to solvents and water degradation. It is typically used in boat hulls, gas tanks, kayaks, canoes and other items that will be exposed to chemicals such as fuel or water for extended periods of time.

-   -MEKP- Catalyst for Vinyl Ester Resin and Polyester Resins

    -   [*MEKP*](https://sales-947.myshopify.com/collections/vinylester-resin/products/mekp-catalyst) (methyl ethyl ketone peroxide) is the necessary catalyst for polyester and vinyl ester resins and gel coats. Without MEKP there will not be the needed chemical reaction that turns the liquid resin into a solid. It is designed for a room temperature cure.

    -   More or less catalyst can be added depending on how long of a pot life and working time is desired. Pot life is the amount of time it takes before the resin hardens in a mixing cup.  Unlike epoxy resin, polyester and vinyl ester cure time can be manipulated by the amounts of MEKP added. Typically, catalyst is used between 1.25% to 1.75% (1 2/3 ounce to 2 1/3 ounces per gallon).

    -   The ideal temperature to work in is 70 degrees. It is not recommended to work in temps under 60 degrees Farenheit and the product could cure too fast if the temperature is above 80 degrees Farenheit.

-   [*Epoxy resin*](https://sales-947.myshopify.com/collections/epoxy-resin)

    -   Two basic kinds of epoxy:

        -   One-component: requires you to provide heat to cure the epoxy.

        -   Two-component: An advanced system that comes in two parts.  The resin side is typically designated as the 'A' side.  The 'B' side is the hardener side. It comes in a variety of mix ratios including 2:1 or 4:1 ratios by weight or volume. For example, a gallon of Part A would require a half gallon of Part B with a 2:1 by weight system. Must be mixed thoroughly and slowly until all striations from the two liquids are invisible/gone, and air bubbles removed before pouring. All corners of the mixing vessel must be scraped to properly mix epoxy. To avoid pouring in unmixed epoxy, you can transfer mixed epoxy from one vessel to another and pour from the second vessel.

    -   Different formulations of epoxy resin exist:

        -   Deep pour: intended to be poured thicker, 1" to 2" thick

        -   Table top: intended to be poured thinner, ⅛" to ¼" thick.  Typically gels faster than "Art", and may have higher hardness and heat deflection. Good for clear coating.

        -   "Art": typically has UV inhibitors added and a longer gel time. Good for clear coating.

        -   "Non-blushing": Doesn't form a waxy coating (amine blush) on cured surfaces, so it saves time for laminating/bonding/etc.

        -   "LV": Low Viscosity resin is thinner than "FLAG" epoxy and can soak into wood better. Better for laminating.

        -   "FLAG": Filling, Laminating and Gluing. A medium viscosity resin. Better for gluing and bonding, filling, and clear coating. Combine with Colloidal Silica to create an excellent thickened high strength adhesive.

        -   "Traditional Marine": a 5:1 system, can be cheaper than 2:1 systems above. A "Fast" and "Slow" hardener are more structural, and the "Clear" hardener is more of a top coat.

            -   For a 5:1 system, based on MAS Epoxy's calculator:

                -   A 96"x96"x0.25" surface area of epoxy is 2304 cubic inches, requiring 1276.45 ounces of mixed epoxy (10 gallons!).

                -   By VOLUME that's 1063.7083 oz Epoxy Resin with 212.7416 oz 520 Slow Hardener.

    -   Some epoxies may come with a filler, for example to replace rotted wood.

    -   Stronger than polyester and vinyl ester resin and is ideal for high performance and light weight parts.

    -   It is water resistant and has good flexibility.

    -   It has great bonding capability and a fast wet out.

    -   Epoxies have a low odor compared to other resins.

    -   One of the only downsides to epoxy is that it is more expensive than polyester and vinyl ester resin.

    -   It can be used with carbon fiber, Kevlar and fiberglass cloth **(NOT compatible with chopped strand mat)**.

    -   There is a choice of three different hardeners for epoxy resin: fast, medium and slow. Which speed of hardener chosen depends on the working temperature, the desired working time and the needed drying time.

    -   Epoxies dry with a full surface cure.

    -   It is ideal to work in temperatures around 75-80 degrees. It is also important to warm up the resin and the working surface to room temperature if it is too cold. **Mixing cold resin will create many air bubbles.** The room and surface should stay warm through the whole curing process (approx. 3 days).

    -   Measuring the correct ratio of A:B is EXTREMELY important. Most problems that occur with improper cure is due to not measuring the correct ratio or not mixing thoroughly. When mixing, the sides and bottom of the mixing cup should be scraped down well.

    -   **It is very important that you do not add extra hardener to try and speed up the cure time.** This will ruin your project.  Instead, heat up the room to accelerate the process.

    -   **Supposedly, you cannot use a gel coat on epoxy resin. However, **[*this link*](https://www.epoxyworks.com/index.php/applying-polyester-gelcoat-over-epoxy/) explains that there is a finishing process you can use to prevent problems.

-   Safety

    -   It is important to wear proper safety clothing to protect you from fumes and from getting hazardous material on your skin.  Always wear a good respirator mask to protect from the fumes during the laminating process. You should also wear a respirator mask when cutting fiberglass, spraying gel coat or resin, working with solvents or sanding the finished laminate.

    -   Wear gloves when working with fiberglass and resin.  [](https://sales-947.myshopify.com/collections/safety/products/nitrile-glove-box-100-count)[*Nitrile gloves*](https://sales-947.myshopify.com/collections/safety/products/nitrile-glove-box-100-count) work best with epoxies. Also, eye protection is a must.  Getting resin or catalyst in your eyes can cause permanent damage. Just the fumes alone could irritate your eyes making it very uncomfortable to work. Make sure the protective eye wear you choose is shatter proof.

#### For Foams

-   Foam Fusion

    -   Adheres very well. Is clear, cleans up easily. Seems to be the best (or one of the best) for foam-to-foam.

    -   Some videos show it not setting up, being wet after 24hrs (when used for screw holes)

-   Foam Fast

    -   Seems to have good strength but need more info

-   PL 300

    -   Suitable for foam to foam, foam to wood. Not sure about other mediums.

-   Gorilla Glue Original

    -   Can adhere well, but not fantastic. Bubbles up when setting, requires clamping. Wet the surface first. Expands and becomes messy around joints. Not suitable for filling gaps, even if it does foam into them.

    -   Polyurethane

    -   Application temp: 40F to 160F

    -   Service temp: -40F to 200F

    -   Waterproof

    -   https://www.buildsite.com/pdf/pl/Loctite-PL-Premium-Polyurethane-Construction-Adhesive-Product-Data-2197650.pdf

-   Wood Glue (PVA)

    -   Will not bond very well. The foam is waterproof/water resistant and wood glue needs something (like wood) to remove the water from the glue for it to set up.

    -   If the foam is sanded roughly and then cleaned with alcohol, wood glue will bond to it.

-   Great Stuff

    -   Messy, expands, needs clamping, but may provide a good bond.  Needs more research

-   E6000

    -   NOT suitable for XPS foam.

-   Notes

    -   "Some suggestions regarding glue application: Polyurethane is activated with moisture (Humidity). The other adhesives need the volatile solvents evaporated, so it helps to use a mastic spreader with fine notches to avoid excessive drying time. All of them should have pressure applied during the cure."

### DIY

-   Materials

    -   Acrylic / Plexiglass

        -   Cheap

        -   Lightweight

        -   Not as good insulation as glass

        -   17x stronger than traditional glass

        -   Clear acrylic is more transparent than glass!

        -   Do not show glare and reflections

        -   Different coatings available

        -   Easier to scratch

    -   Polycarbonate / Lexan

        -   250x stronger than traditional glass, 30x stronger than acrylic

        -   Just as clear as glass

        -   Structurally strong

        -   Different grades available

    -   Vinyl

        -   Cheap

    -   Laminated glass

        -   Increased strength but hard to cut

    -   Tempered glass

        -   Increased strength

        -   Prone to shattering

-   Potential problems

    -   Glass expands???

-   Design

    -   The walls will be 2-⅛" thick!! That means we can design a window that thick, like a triple-glazed!

    -   "Glazing compound -- Used to seal glass panes together into an airtight insulating unit. Look for high quality brands like DAP or OSI. Silicone or latex based compounds work well."

    -   "Glazing putty tape -- The putty tape creates an airtight seal around glass unit edges. Get the right thickness to match your window depth."

    -   " In all the dual-pane windows I\'ve worked with, the spacer is a permanent part of the installation. That is the professional way, and attention to that detail and the adhesive used determines success or failure. Silicone caulk isn\'t a structural material suited to be a glass separator."

    -   "\[Silicones\] have high gas permeability: at room temperature (25 °C), the permeability of silicone rubber for such gases as oxygen is approximately 400 times\[citation needed\] that of butyl rubber, making silicone useful for medical applications in which increased aeration is desired. Consequently, silicone rubbers cannot be used where gas-tight seals are necessary."

    -   "It\'s possible to make them yourself if you get the right materials. For spacers search in Amazon for \"Dual Seal Aluminum Spacer\". For the sealer use a PIB Primary seal tape that wraps around the top, outside edge, and bottom of the spacer. Search in Amazon for \"CRL Polyisobutylene Primary Seal\". This stuff remains flexible and is very tacky."

    -   "If you use Butyl Rubber around perimeter except a small part and use a heat lamp to heat interior section, then seal the short part, it will be like canning tomatoes. When it cools, a vacuum will be formed !"

    -   "Kind of tangential here but file this away as another approach: I built a skylight 40 years ago out of acrylic sheets (\"Plexiglass\") using acrylic solvent to bond the edges of the double-paned center portion. It\'s still sealed after all these years. I didn\'t take all the precautions that were possible - leak testing and using adhesive where leaks existed; back filling with Argon; **inserting gel to soak up moisture** etc etc."

    -   "Pella windows uses an installed window and then a panel that is installed like a storm window on the inside. The sides of the window has vents on each side high and low. No fogging with insulating qualities. The windows I had never fogged. If you have tools and some skills this could be attempted. Their gap was near 3/4\" but some insulating qualities could still be achieved in the space used for insulated panels."

    -   "using glass cleaner clean glass. Important!"

-   Implementation

    -   [*https://www.33rdsquare.com/can-you-make-your-own-double-pane-window-the-ultimate-diy-guide/*](https://www.33rdsquare.com/can-you-make-your-own-double-pane-window-the-ultimate-diy-guide/)

    -   [*https://www.instructables.com/Make-a-maintainable-double-glazed-window/*](https://www.instructables.com/Make-a-maintainable-double-glazed-window/)

        -   " The sash of the window is the trick to this design. It acts as the spacer between the sheets of glass; it provides a place for the O-rings that seal the glass to the frame; it provides a place to add trim, which holds the glass in place; and it provides a structure that supports the glass."

    -   [*https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Double-Glazing/*](https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Double-Glazing/)

## Doors

-   Very expensive, \$1000+ (unless on sale!)

-   Screen door would be a great idea

-   Window for both looking out and to get more light in. Can be skinny and long (vertical)

-   Multiple deadbolts for security

    -   Maybe make them clamping latches so it tightly pulls the door closed. Better for when you're bumping down a trail, or it's winter and you want to tightly seal out the cold

    -   Double seals!

-   Design the entrance so the water runs outside if water leaks in

-   Some doors have an integrated long handle (to pull yourself up) and waste bin

-   Four hinges are better than two

-   Setting the door into the wall will make it so a bear (or human?) has to dig into the wall to get leverage on the door.

    -   Metal flashing important to reinforce the edge of the door from attacks, as well as keep it rigid for holding up the door, and to reinforce the joint when tightly sealing it for winter

-   "High-security" metal screen

    -   "The screen door features a stainless steel powder-coated #6 woven mesh with .040 wire. #6 was chosen because it is the largest mesh that a grizzly cannot get a claw into. The door frame is recessed to foil prying claws or tools."

-   Sliding door??

-   Make door corners rounded to avoid point loading on corners/edges

## Heating

### Propane

-   Propex: [*https://www.propexheatsource.com/heaters/hs2000-furnace/*](https://www.propexheatsource.com/heaters/hs2000-furnace/)

    -   Has a thermostat

    -   12V Power draw: 1.9A continous running, 0.04A standby

    -   60 CFM

    -   Heat output: 6483 BTU

    -   Make sure to buy a North American version for the correct gas fitting

    -   Exhaust Flue Length: Total combined length must not exceed 4 meters and the inlet pipe should be slightly longer than the exhaust to balance the burner.

    -   Outlets: The maximum recommended is 3, providing the total combined length of ducting is no longer than 5 metres and the maximum length to the first outlet should not exceed 1.5m.

### Diesel/Gas

-   [*https://www.amazon.com/Eberspacher-Airtronic-Heater-Kit-Gasoline/dp/B0BF12GBN3*](https://www.amazon.com/Eberspacher-Airtronic-Heater-Kit-Gasoline/dp/B0BF12GBN3)

    -   "The Eberspacher B2L is engineered to operate in extreme conditions and high altitudes. It can operate in temperatures as low as -46°C / - 50°F and at altitudes of up to 18K feet.  This is possible thanks to its integrated altitude sensor, and unlike earlier models there is no additional wiring or installation required for high altitude operation."

-   [*https://velitcamping.com/products/velit-gasoline-air-heater-17000btu*](https://velitcamping.com/products/velit-gasoline-air-heater-17000btu)

    -   "With the built-in barometer, the Velit air heater has the industry\'s highest elevation rating (16000ft) so you will have warm air wherever you go. The barometer inside the controller senses the air pressure and adjusts the air-fuel mix ratio accordingly to provide better high-elevation performance and reduce carbon build-up."

        -   Flexible installation with 90° tilt possible to either side

-   Air

    -   Exhaust

        -   The exhaust outlet must be arranged so as to prevent any penetration of exhaust fumes into the vehicle interior through the ventilation system, warm air intakes or open windows.

    -   Combustion air intake

        -   The air for the heater\'s combustion chamber may not be drawn in from the vehicle\'s passenger compartment. The air intake must be arranged or protected in such a way that it cannot be blocked by other objects.

    -   Hot air intake

        -   The hot air supply must consist of fresh air or circulated air and must be drawn in from a clean area, which cannot be contaminated by exhaust fumes from the engine, the combustion heater or any other source in the vehicle.

-   Someone has suggested that at high altitude, bigger ducting (75+) is better, because it lets more oxygen in, otherwise you can have overheating issues

-   It occurred to me you need battery to operate the heater... in Winter... so what happens when you run out of battery, and how are you going to charge your battery in Winter? Solar? Fat chance.  Alternator? Not without a second one. So shore power or genny would be the only options.

    -   It could be that propane heating is just more reliable in winter, because I don't need a fan to run a Mr. Buddy.

        -   So seriously consider a spot outside to put a 20lb propane tank.

        -   And estimate how long I could run a heater on it, compared to my big-ass battery bank with the Espar or Velit.

## Electrical

### Batteries

-   NOTES:

    -   [*https://www.truckcamperadventure.com/how-to-properly-charge-an-rv-lithium-battery/*](https://www.truckcamperadventure.com/how-to-properly-charge-an-rv-lithium-battery/)

    -   Do not keep at 100 percent charge!

    -   Use a "Lithium battery" charger setting to charge at 14.6V

    -   Charge at 80% of battery capacity amperage, or suggested amp rate of the battery

    -   Use an "Anderson plug" to quick-disconnect the alternator from the DC-DC charger

    -   [*https://www.truckcamperadventure.com/ditching-the-generator-for-the-alternator/*](https://www.truckcamperadventure.com/ditching-the-generator-for-the-alternator/)

        -   Goes into use of 24v system and a second alternator

### Charger/Inverter

-   "Because the air conditioner increases power demand on the electrical system, we'd recommend selecting a 2000W inverter/charger. It's possible to go with a 3000W inverter/charger, but be aware that this might overload the system during peak power (e.g. when the inverter and the air conditioner are both running simultaneously at max power)." (https://faroutride.com/12v-air-con/)

### Generator

-   [*https://www.campervan-hq.com/products/ecoflow-smart-generator-dual-fuel*](https://www.campervan-hq.com/products/ecoflow-smart-generator-dual-fuel)

-   NOTES

    -   Check what outputs the generator has (12v, 120v, pure sine wave, etc)

### Cell booster

-   [*https://www.campervan-hq.com/collections/cell-phone-signal-boosters*](https://www.campervan-hq.com/collections/cell-phone-signal-boosters)

### Solar

-   One thing to keep in mind is wiring together a lot of solar panels has a lot of considerations

    -   Are you getting 12V, 24V, a range?

    -   How many amps?

    -   Size and run of cables?

    -   If you have different panels connected together, you end up getting the lowest voltage of all of them, which is bad

    -   You can run multiple separate solar controllers so that you can keep your solar panels separate and get the most voltage from each of them

        -   One controller for roof panels

        -   One controller for the foldable panels

### Tires

-   Type

    -   P (Passenger)

        -   4-6 ply

        -   lighter loads, smoother ride

        -   when p-metric tires are mounted on a truck (or an SUV) their load calculation must be reduced by 9 percent (a difference of more than 350 pounds per tire)

    -   LT (Light Truck)

        -   8-10 ply

        -   reinforced sidewalls, heavy duty, stiffer ride

-   Load Range

    -   SL

        -   4-ply, 36psi, 44lbs weight, 1,477lbs load

        -   normal road conditions, quieter, smoother ride, fuel efficient, cheaper, thinner

    -   XL

        -   4-ply, 41psi

        -   handles heavier loads than SL

    -   C

        -   6-ply, 35-50psi, 1760-2270lbs load

        -   normal road conditions, smoother ride

    -   D

        -   8-ply, 60psi, 1925 lbs load

    -   E

        -   10-ply, 65-80psi, 52lbs weight, 2470-3415lbs load

        -   heavy-duty and towing, louder, not fuel efficient, expensive, thicker

-   Load Index

    -   100: 1,764 lbs

    -   108: 2,205 lbs

    -   112: 2,469 lbs

    -   118: 2,910 lbs

-   Notes

    -   "If you don\'t exceed the rear GAWR of your F-150, then you gain nothing by replacing P-Series XL (extra load that are standard on my F-150) with LT tires. My stock P-series tires have more weight capacity at 44 PSI than normal Load Range C LT tires at max 50 PSI."

    -   "In order to give this F150 some off road prowess without going overboard, we reached for our Boss Trail Package 2 and added some new Method NV wheels and a set of 305/65R18 BFG KO2 Tires"

        -   "Before we set up our 2015 F150 XLT with a Boss Trail Package, we first had it sitting on a Halo Lifts 2-Inch Leveling Kit to help us grab a little extra clearance in the wheel wells and to bring up the front ride height.  This pair of strut spacers and hardware adds two inches of ride height to the front of our truck which provides more clearance for big tires while getting rid of most of the truck\'s factory rake. Even though this kit wasn\'t installed for long, it was a solid system that makes for a cheap and easy way to fit larger wheels and tires.  2004-2017 F150 Halo Lifts 2\" Leveling Kit"

        -   "Our 2015 F150 XLT Project Truck was always destined to be a fun trail truck that also drove well on the street and could tow and haul when needed. Keeping in mind that we needed this truck to do a bit of everything, we grabbed a Boss Trail Suspension Package 2. This awesome suspension overhaul includes a set of Halo Lifts Boss 2.0 Coilovers, Halo Lifts Boss 2.0 Rear Shocks, a ReadyLift 3\" Rear Block, and ICON Upper Control Arms which gave our truck excellent on-road ride quality and much better off-road performance and handling over the factory suspension components. We even splurged a little and got the coilovers a white spring and both the rear shocks and front coilover bodies Halo Lift\'s Carbon WeatherWrap which gave all the dampers a great look with our white and black styling.[ ](https://www.stage3motorsports.com/S3M-1516TRAIL2-2015-2016-F150-Stage-3-BOSS-Trail-Suspension-Pack-2.html)[***2015-2017 F150 S3M Boss Trail Suspension Package 2***](https://www.stage3motorsports.com/S3M-1516TRAIL2-2015-2016-F150-Stage-3-BOSS-Trail-Suspension-Pack-2.html)"

        -   "The Method NV wheels we threw on our 2015 XLT Project Truck looked awesome, but the +18mm offset kept them tucked in the wheel wells pretty tightly. Since we wanted a wider stance and some extra clearance for our UCAs, we grabbed a full set of four BORA 1.75\" Wheel Spacers. BORA\'s spacers are made out of extremely strong billet aluminum and drop right onto your F150\'s hubs without modifications in their 1.75\" size (1.25\" spacers and below require stud trimming). BORA\'s spacers worked exactly as advertised and gave our truck an awesome stance and more horizontal clearance in no time.[ ](https://www.stage3motorsports.com/BORA-F1501-75X4-2004-2015-F150-BORA-6x135mm-1-75-Wheel-Spacers-Four.html)[***2015-2017 F150 BORA 1.75-inch Wheel Spacers***](https://www.stage3motorsports.com/BORA-F1501-75X4-2004-2015-F150-BORA-6x135mm-1-75-Wheel-Spacers-Four.html)"

        -   "Now that our 2015 F150 Project Truck had new Method wheels, it was time to find a solid set of tires to wrap them in.  Our tires of choice were 305/65R18 BFG KO2 All-Terrains.  The BFG KO2\'s are a fan favorite in the off road world and it\'s not hard to see why. With their aggressive tread design, tough sidewalls and low road noise, these tires are a perfect fit for any truck that needs to take you to work and also get you out on the trails.[ ](https://www.stage3motorsports.com/BFG08017-30565R18-BF-Goodrich-All-Terrain-TA-KO2-Tire.html)[***305/65R18 BFG KO2 Tires***](https://www.stage3motorsports.com/BFG08017-30565R18-BF-Goodrich-All-Terrain-TA-KO2-Tire.html)"

-   Upper control arms

    -   "We wanted to make sure we increased the articulation of our F150 to get the most out of our Icon coilovers without destroying the truck\'s suspension geometry. Upper control arms are the most effective way to do this, so we tossed on a pair of BDS arms that we knew would be up to the task. These BDS UCAs combine an extremely strong tubular steel construction with an uprated MOOG Ball Joint that\'s more durable than the stock ball joint and is installed in an indexed housing to allow for more deflection and articulation in our front suspension.[ ](https://www.stage3motorsports.com/123253-2004-2018-F150-BDS-Tubular-Ball-Joint-Upper-Control-Arms.html)[***04-18 F150 BDS Tubular Ball Joint Upper Control Arms***](https://www.stage3motorsports.com/123253-2004-2018-F150-BDS-Tubular-Ball-Joint-Upper-Control-Arms.html)"

    -   "The color combo is a great fit for this truck and the 17x8.5\" sizing allows us to fit a 34\" tire with lots of delightfully squishy sidewall for airing down on the trail"

    -   "decided to mix things up with a set of 315/70R17 BFGoodrich KO2 All Terrains. These KO2\'s are an extremely popular tire in the off road community and that\'s not by accident. They are comfortable and relatively quiet on the street while still being capable and durable in the most technical terrain making them an ideal tire for any overland build. Now, with these tires being essentially 34\" we did have to get creative with trimming inside the fenders and along the bottoms of the factory flares to prevent rubbing. Even though it\'s not just simple \"bolt-on\" fitment, the look is certainly worth it!"


## Aerodynamics

-   The "teardrop" or "duck tail" shape is the most aerodynamically efficient.

-   There isn't a ton of mpg savings to be had in aerodynamics, so don't go crazy with it
-   General rules of thumb
    -   #1. Reduce your overall frontal area. Look at a picture of the front of the vehicle. If it's big, that's going to affect air resistance the most.
    -   #2. Radius the corners (especially in front) at least 6″. This will allow the air to flow over the corners without separating.
    -   #3. Allow a 7% transition to keep airflow attached
    -   #4. Eliminate as many protuberances as possible. (that includes even a 1 inch difference from outer skin to windows -- which is why so many newer cars have flush fitting glass)
