# Research / Ideas

-   Slide-out and fold-out trays to put things on

-   Slide-out pantry storage

-   Fold-down tray for over-cab bed can be folded up during the day to make more space

-   Small shelves on either side of bed

-   Swiveling table convert into additional bed

-   Bench seating doubles as storage, second bed

-   Tilt-out drawers can give access without taking up door-swing-out space

-   Mirror on door for bathroom

-   For DIY shell, use laminated beams, 3/16th plywood, cedarwood where possible, and cover with 1 mat of fiberglass and then 1 layer cloth (cloth also around corners)

-   If you have enough battery power, no need for propane!

-   Christmas tree LED lights for lighting

-   For panels use [*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibre-reinforced_plastic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibre-reinforced_plastic) or AMC panels

-   If the water containers are next to a hot appliance like a water heater they won't freeze in winter

-   Building materials: corrugated plastic, plywood, fiberglass, wood, tin or aluminum sheeting, aluminum square tube, polyurethane board, fibre-reinforced plastic, MDF, particle board, OSB, eko ply, HDF, reinforced polyurethane foam, HDPE, marine-grade plywood

-   Insulated panels glued to inside of plywood frame helps reinforce structural integrity (a little?)

-   Fiberglass over windows to prevent need to caulk and maintain them later

-   Install USB charging ports in convenient places

-   Locate batteries inside truck cab or in space between shell and the truck bed

-   Total Composites' shell made of foam and FRP, R12 insulation: [*https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2022/04/TotalComposites-700x393.jpg*](https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2022/04/TotalComposites-700x393.jpg)

-   Use laminated beams for the shell

-   Putting storage of items in the front interior wall of the shell will make more floor space (and put more weight towards the center)

-   DIY water sink [*https://vanlifecustoms.com/blog/diysink*](https://vanlifecustoms.com/blog/diysink)

-   Put little strappy things on the ceiling to hang gear from, modularly

-   Hammocks??

-   Use the cooler fridge as a table top (when it's closed)

-   French cleats? Or something like them that stays put?

-   Full wet bath can be located towards middle of truck right before the cab-over bed; fridge/other appliance on the opposite side

-   For shelves/storage, sliding doors like on a boat's cabinets?

-   LED lights interior/exterior

-   Range top exhaust can just be a hood + fan on the side wall or roof right above the stove

-   "Lagoon table" swivels around

-   Slide-out bed: wood slats that go under a bench seat but pull out and foam bench seat goes on top

-   Carbon monoxide detectors

-   20-amp AC outlets?

-   Fuse box

-   For bathroom: shower curtain, rolling shower door

-   Wet bath: shower head connected to faucet, connected to water heater, with toilet on floor

-   Wet bath can just be a shower curtain around a toilet? Take down curtain and you can then cover the toilet with a solid piece and now use that vertical space for something else

-   Clean water tank, gray water tank

-   Automatic switch from internal power to external shore power

-   Different port for city water, so you use city water instead of the internal clean water tank

-   Ports on the outside to drain water

-   Rather than one giant bed, install storage boxes on either side of bed, or just one side of bed and mesh gear holders on the other side

-   Window on the cab-over. Might also serve as an emergency exit

-   Fan in the cab-over bed

-   Make sure there's ventilation under the bed for the cab-over bed

-   For any storage cubbies, cut out some holes (inside the cubbies, like between walls) to allow ventilation into the storage cubbies so mold doesn't grow as easily

-   ~~Wood stove as alternative to propane??~~

-   The Soaring Eagle campers have a rear spoiler extension thingy that might be for aerodynamics. Maybe take this idea and extend it as a rain protection thing?

-   Get a microwave + toaster oven combo

-   ~~Fridge that runs on either electric or propane?~~ Meh, have electric cooler to start with

-   "ceiling mounted, low-amperage draw air conditioner, MaxxAir fan with rain sensor, Blackstone Griddle, roof solar packages, lithium batteries, a Dometic powered cooler, electric jacks, quick-detach jacks and more"

-   Use a Liftback in order to have a Kammback during driving, and a lifted ceiling when parked

-   Long windows that can angle out for ventilation

-   Lack of vertical walls inside the camper will make it seem more open and allow more natural light, save weight, allow easier airflow

-   Put table top on interior roof with fold-out leg. To use table, just grab tabletop off roof, clip into two points on the interior, extend leg, and you have a table (table top can be foam wrapped in vinyl or doorskin for light weight+rigidity)

-   Interior window into truck cab

-   Water level indicator for water tanks

-   Use inline fuses rather than fuse box when it makes sense

-   Windows should have mesh screen and a sun-blocking sliding panel

-   "Locking drawers" so they don't slide around

-   Slide-out bread board

-   Tip-out tray in front of sink to use up little bit of space where full drawer won't go

-   Better to get a fridge that doesn't need to be level and doesn't need ventilation

-   If you were to make a pop-up, shocks could help raise it automatically

-   Two 10gal propane tanks on a sliding tray will make it so you can switch which tank you are using and keep using one while you get the other one filled so the truck is never without propane. (You could also wait until you\'re out and then drive to a place to exchange one tank)

-   Use space under floor for a slide out storage tray at the door for dirty gear

-   Exterior clean water spigot so you can get drinking water, wash things off, shower (if not showering indoors)

-   "Wildlands" door has 2-piece, is nice. Teardrop campers may have smaller doors. But think about what you want to get in and out; will a whole bike fit? Where's the kayak going?

-   "Front mud room" can just be a plastic bin with a lid, or maybe a plastic bin with the front face cut off so you can throw your boots in it. Plastic tray on floor when walk in can collect initial water, can plop it on top of mud room bin after removing boots

-   Make the bench seats open-face and under it is storage. Use aluminum to construct the seat top so it's strong enough for sitting with the face open.

-   12V fan in top corner of box for breeze

-   Mount for speaker on wall

-   LED lights on ceiling

-   Bendable LED light on wall

-   Think again about marine interiors, doors, hinges, slides, latches, locks, netting

-   Think about storage: pantry, 4-season clothes, 4-season gear, cooler, cooktop, pots, pans, cups, plates, utensils, cutting board, batteries, electrical panel, DC-DC battery charger, solar generator, power inverter, cell booster, starlink, heater, water heater, water tanks, sink, toilet, shower, trash can, compost, laundry, boots, jackets, laptop/tech gear, outdoor tools, power tools, woodwork tools, truck repair tools

-   If installing an A/C, think about putting the vent high so the cool air comes down. Want it in bed? Maybe fan blowing it up?

-   Think about accessories: 110V, 12V, USB, light switches

-   I didn't think about it before but I might be able to wire up the DC-DC battery charger to the alternator so I can just use the truck's engine/alternator as a generator to charge the battery bank

    -   Look up max amperage usable when car is parked or driving

    -   Consider upgrading the alternator, cost would effectively replace a generator. Maybe look into efficiency, truck might be too inefficient at idle, risk running out of gas when remote

-   Have a main battery/electircal shutoff switch for emergencies

-   Have a fire extinguisher

-   Have a way to tell when water is running low

-   Have a way to tell when propane is running low, or have two small tanks, or one big tank and one small reserve tank (you'd only really need it for heating food or emergency heat, and I can be 4-season equipped to stretch it)

-   Be able to carry a jerry can of water or similar into a truck stop to fill up on water and bring back to the truck to fill up

    -   Collapsible plastic large water container?

-   Be able to carry poop, pee, and gray water, out of the truck and dump in a public toilet or porta potty

-   Make the camper as wide as the mirrors; if the mirrors fit, the camper fits

-   Look up typical size limits for parking structures, drive throughs

-   Get windows with hidden or removable bug screens so it doesn't obscure my view

-   Aluminum honeycomb is both lighter and stronger than sheet aluminum, though thicker

-   Large-scale water purifier for refreshing water tank from questionable sources

-   Think about venting the heat from the fridge, possibly insulating the fridge

-   Rear of camper could hang over the tailgate, or angle out diagonally

-   Using aluminum (or steel?) angle iron on the external edges could be both an exoskeleton and armor for tree branches

-   Corners of box don't have to be 90 degrees, could instead use a 45 degree corner so it's blunted but maybe stronger? Maybe takes hits better since not a sharp edge?

-   Think about an awning before committing to exterior design

-   Tub floor to contain water

-   Interior walls could be lined with fabric, but then how do you clean it?

-   Think about maybe having fixed in place windows and ventilation somehow else

-   Emergency exits: what if someone blocks the rear door?

-   For storage, could build a sliding track door for cabinets instead of opening-out doors

-   Cabinets can have slots to reconfigure shelves. Tracks?

-   Table could have leafs to open up wider

-   Probably better to keep the batteries inside the truck than outside; could mount under the bed but would need to insulate and armor, check how truck bottoms out

-   Heated floors??

-   Put aluminum panel on floor, put ice cubes?? Cool feet, whole body stays cool?

-   Bed extends out over kitchen which is front of truck bed; could just move a whole panel in place, or use sliders or something

-   Remember that you want a pass-through in the front of the truck too!

    -   Build in a removable door/window

    -   Don't place anything in middle front lower part of truck?

    -   Is that where the sink is??

-   Some people make a "garage" which is accessed from outside with access to an inside storage compartment

-   Roof stuff

    -   Starlink

    -   Solar

    -   Vent sunroof (maybe don't get one if other vents exist? helps with light/air but is a thermal suck)

-   If the bed slides out into the camper, then I don\'t even need a very long or tall cabover. Just make it as tall as I need to stand up, and build the bed to slide out for sleeping. I should have plenty of headroom in the middle of the camper

-   If the windows are at the top, and so is the bed, I should always have a view, and the floor can be storage for better weight distribution

-   If the middle is the pass through, maybe make a table top right under the pass through?

-   Wire up the trailer lights to the slide-in camper so you get rear lights

-   Get a second backup camera, set up a quick-connect so a second backup camera can work from the camper, or just reinstall the backup camera to the bumper

-   Indoor/Outdoor thermometer

-   Sideways-oriented cooktop allows for more counter space

-   Building out the shell with an inside that has a million mounting brackets allows me to change the internal layout later on. The only thing that needs to stay out are the windows and the ports for liquid, electrical, propane, etc

-   Can make a dinette seat that folds up to reveal a toilet (or storage)

-   [*https://helinox.com/products/sunset-chair?variant=44571752759470*](https://helinox.com/products/sunset-chair?variant=44571752759470)

-   Create a "shower tub" - a tub that can come out and have a shower curtain around/inside it, so you can take a shower, then dump the gray water.

    -   This could be where you put wet or muddy items.

    -   Maybe have a small folding metal stand inside so you can raise gear off the bottom so it dries out better

    -   Maybe have a drying rack above it for wet or washed clothes, towels

    -   Maybe have this built into the truck as a "wet bath", and have a water drain with a drain plug and mesh to prevent bugs getting in (mud daubers!)

-   Wherever there is an external access panel door, make sure it has a water-tight rubber seal

-   Cargo netting to stuff... stuff

-   Build air ducting into the camper for both air conditioning and heating

-   Build a cover for the rear of the air conditioner, to seal in heat, protect the fins from damage, eliminate dust entry, and make the unit look more visually pleasing

SO COOL BUT UNNECESSARY

-   The entire back wall lifts up and out on shocks (or out and down?) to expose the camper for full patio mode. Maybe both ways?? Up so you can be protected from the rain, Down so you can have an extremely unnecessary patio. Screen door/shade to protect from bugs.

-   "Burning Man Mode": Seals unit but leaves air filters in place where ventilation needed to prevent dust incursion. Windows covered by reflective panels to prevent heat. Electric fans that automatically kick in for ventilation. A/C. Sensitive parts not exposed to prevent corrosion. All exterior panels are water/dust tight. Sun shade mode. Can cover with aluminet.

-   Boot and jacket mud room entrance

-   Disassemble the walls and interior.

    -   The bottom can be a platform with channels around it

    -   Each wall can slot into the bottom channel, and into each adjoining wall

    -   Clamp hinges can lock all the pieces together
