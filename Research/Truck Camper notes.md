-   A topper with a pop up tent

-   \$8450

-   The lightest, simplest one of these (supposedly)

-   This makes me sort of question the whole idea of a camper. With one
    > of these, you\'re basically just adding a tent to your truck. But
    > it\'s strong and premium quality, and you\'re saving space in the

[]{#anchor-5}Reminders

-   Estimate weight and check wet weight capacity of vehicle

-   Check marine stores for RV parts

-   Gut an old RV to get cheap parts (windows, cabinets, fridge, heater,
    > jacks, door, stairs, water tanks)

-   Insulation can be held to top of camper with some cloth

-   Use rot-resistant materials anywhere possible, water is what
    > destroys RVs

-   With wet bath, needs to drain no matter what incline you're on

-   If you end up with a crew cab you can use it for storage and build a
    > pass-through

-   If you have a toilet and no sink where the toilet is, your kitchen
    > sink is now your bathroom sink too

-   Install electrical (lights, 12V/110V, appliances, pumps) and
    > plumbing before finishing insulation and interior
    > upholstery/flooring

-   Consider thickness of walls before installing windows

-   Teardrop shaped over-cab can help aerodynamics

-   Don't run data and electrical lines in parallel

-   Run some 110V lines as well as 12V so you can charge some accessory
    > AC-powered devices

-   Consider external ports for water and electrical for hookups at RV
    > parks

-   Consider the roof placement for solar panels, Starlink, and a
    > hatch+fan for ventilation

-   Upper cabinets contribute to top-heavy; keep the top light

-   Consider how you'll install lift jacks, tie-down points

-   Make the roof curved upward to make rain fall off it

-   You may need a breaker box as a junction for external, internal
    > power

-   Plumbing needs to drain downward

-   Remember to mark where studs, lines are for later installing stuff

-   If there is thermal bridging, water will form on the interior and
    > bead down. Supposedly honeycomb panels provide no insulation, a
    > solid frame creates a thermal bridge.
    > [*https://totalcomposites.com/composite-panels-debunked/*](https://totalcomposites.com/composite-panels-debunked/)

-   Remember a fire extinguisher and think about how to put out a fire
    > quickly

-   Fire-proofing upholstery

-   Frame mounts reduce body roll

-   "Because it comes out 6" over the end of the truck bed it has its
    > own rear lights"
    > ([*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNoplsCcZMA*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNoplsCcZMA))

-   Batteries might not charge if not warm enough. Might want to
    > ventilate battery box

-   Keep water tanks in camper so no need to winterize them

-   During winter, if you run your heater and kill your propane tank,
    > you gotta go outside to change out the propane tanks

-   Single-pane windows will get condensation and then freeze solid in
    > winter

-   Think about where icicles may form, snow may accumulate

-   Try to figure out how much it affects vehicle when you add weight to
    > left or right of top of vehicle

-   The width of the camper can be within the width of the mirrors
    > 96.8\")

-   Remember to winter prep both the water tanks, houses, and propane

-   Remember a temperature sensor and hygrometer

-   Think about how to vent the camper

-   100amp fuse boxes with breakers for all power needs (breaker box)

-   Figure out best way to hook up charging from the truck into the
    > internal battery

-   Internal battery will need to be charged by shore power, car, and
    > solar

-   Will want both internal and external access to 12V DC, 115V AC, and
    > USB including fast charging

-   Will want to consider a large DC AC inverter that will run off the
    > internal battery

-   Should have switches to shut off all nonessential electronics to
    > save battery, in addition to fuse box

-   Remember a fire extinguisher

-   Will want both inlet and outlet for clean and gray water. Place
    > outlets where they can drain easily

-   Splash some gray water treatment into the sink after you empty the
    > gray water tank

-   Keep a bucket in the truck for emptying gray water

-   Condensation will build up on interior surfaces sometimes, keep in
    > mind

-   Interior compartments that don\'t have ventilation will be prone to
    > mold

-   A fan circulating air will probably be critical to proper humidity
    > control in the absence of a heater, dehumidifier, or air
    > conditioner

-   Another option for interior compartment humidity control is silica
    > gel or similar

-   Soft top Pop-ups have a lot of issues

    -   Blocking windows

    -   Closing unit can be finicky when soft top doesn\'t move in
        > properly or items in the camper gets in the way

    -   Ice and snow can build up on the exterior making closing the
        > camper not work right

    -   Less insulation

    -   Sun probably will fade the soft windows

-   \"I have a ARE DCU (topper) on my Ram 2500. I also had one on my
    > previous F350. I love them for working out of. I\'ve also
    > insulated and paneled my current one so it makes a pretty decent

    > outside, it will be stolen

-   Steel skid plates are heavy (180-250lbs!) but the lower center of
    > gravity weight can help stability

-   Aluminum roof is very loud in rain; maybe add high density vinyl
    > panels

-   Think again about each season and location the truck will be in for
    > design requirements

    -   Adirondacks in Winter

        -   -18F temps for 2 weeks

        -   How to make sure the water doesn't freeze?

            -   If external tanks, needs insulation and warming wire.

            -   What kind of power requirement is that? Will solar be
                > available?

-   Plastic windows are lighter and cheaper but will probably fade at
    > some point or get scratched

-   Whatever propane accessories you have plumbed inside, need to stay
    > inside. Otherwise you have to shut off the main propane valve,
    > remove the interior propane thing, vent the propane, etc. So a mr
    > buddy heater inside that comes out for camping may be a no-go.

-   Swing-arm tables are floppy, fixed tables are not

-   Pop-up canopies will eventually weather and leak

-   Make it so you can stay inside the truck to do whatever you need if
    > it's raining, snowing, hot, dust storm, etc

-   Minimize weight in the construction on the top to lessen
    > top-heaviness

-   Think about how hard it\'s gonna be to back the truck under the
    > camper on jacks. The tighter the fit, the harder it\'ll be to line
    > up

-   The camper body may actually need to flex and move independent of
    > the bed, so it might need extra space in bed to move around

-   Think about tie down points

-   Look up bridge heights because you may end up on Google directions
    > where you have to go under a bridge which has a minimum height

-   "Over the past five years, a lot of companies started using a
    > honeycomb core with fiberglass on either side. The resulting panel

-   Slide-out and fold-out trays to put things on

-   Slide-out pantry storage

-   Fold-down tray for over-cab bed can be folded up during the day to
    > make more space

-   Small shelves on either side of bed

-   Swiveling table convert into additional bed

-   Bench seating doubles as storage, second bed

-   Tilt-out drawers can give access without taking up door-swing-out
    > space

-   Mirror on door for bathroom

-   For DIY shell, use laminated beams, 3/16th plywood, cedarwood where
    > possible, and cover with 1 mat of fiberglass and then 1 layer
    > cloth (cloth also around corners)

-   If you have enough battery power, no need for propane!

-   Christmas tree LED lights for lighting

-   For panels use
    > [*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibre-reinforced_plastic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibre-reinforced_plastic)
    > or AMC panels

-   If the water containers are next to a hot appliance like a water
    > heater they won't freeze in winter

-   Building materials: corrugated plastic, plywood, fiberglass, wood,
    > tin or aluminum sheeting, aluminum square tube, polyurethane
    > board, fibre-reinforced plastic, MDF, particle board, OSB, eko
    > ply, HDF, reinforced polyurethane foam, HDPE, marine-grade plywood

-   Insulated panels glued to inside of plywood frame helps reinforce
    > structural integrity (a little?)

-   Fiberglass over windows to prevent need to caulk and maintain them
    > later

-   Install USB charging ports in convenient places

-   Locate batteries inside truck cab or in space between shell and the
    > truck bed

-   Total Composites' shell made of foam and FRP, R12 insulation:
    > [*https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2022/04/TotalComposites-700x393.jpg*](https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2022/04/TotalComposites-700x393.jpg)

-   Use laminated beams for the shell

-   Putting storage of items in the front interior wall of the shell
    > will make more floor space (and put more weight towards the
    > center)

-   DIY water sink
    > [*https://vanlifecustoms.com/blog/diysink*](https://vanlifecustoms.com/blog/diysink)

-   Put little strappy things on the ceiling to hang gear from,
    > modularly

-   Hammocks??

-   Use the cooler fridge as a table top (when it's closed)

-   French cleats? Or something like them that stays put?

-   Full wet bath can be located towards middle of truck right before
    > the cab-over bed; fridge/other appliance on the opposite side

-   For shelves/storage, sliding doors like on a boat's cabinets?

-   LED lights interior/exterior

-   Range top exhaust can just be a hood + fan on the side wall or roof
    > right above the stove

-   "Lagoon table" swivels around

-   Slide-out bed: wood slats that go under a bench seat but pull out
    > and foam bench seat goes on top

-   Carbon monoxide detectors

-   20-amp AC outlets?

-   Fuse box

-   For bathroom: shower curtain, rolling shower door

-   Wet bath: shower head connected to faucet, connected to water
    > heater, with toilet on floor

-   Wet bath can just be a shower curtain around a toilet? Take down
    > curtain and you can then cover the toilet with a solid piece and
    > now use that vertical space for something else

-   Clean water tank, gray water tank

-   Automatic switch from internal power to external shore power

-   Different port for city water, so you use city water instead of the
    > internal clean water tank

-   Ports on the outside to drain water

-   Rather than one giant bed, install storage boxes on either side of
    > bed, or just one side of bed and mesh gear holders on the other
    > side

-   Window on the cab-over. Might also serve as an emergency exit

-   Fan in the cab-over bed

-   Make sure there's ventilation under the bed for the cab-over bed

-   For any storage cubbies, cut out some holes (inside the cubbies,
    > like between walls) to allow ventilation into the storage cubbies
    > so mold doesn't grow as easily

-   ~~Wood stove as alternative to propane??~~

-   The Soaring Eagle campers have a rear spoiler extension thingy that
    > might be for aerodynamics. Maybe take this idea and extend it as a
    > rain protection thing?

-   Get a microwave + toaster oven combo

-   ~~Fridge that runs on either electric or propane?~~ Meh, have
    > electric cooler to start with

-   "ceiling mounted, low-amperage draw air conditioner, MaxxAir fan
    > with rain sensor, Blackstone Griddle, roof solar packages, lithium
    > batteries, a Dometic powered cooler, electric jacks, quick-detach
    > jacks and more"

-   Use a Liftback in order to have a Kammback during driving, and a
    > lifted ceiling when parked

-   Long windows that can angle out for ventilation

-   Lack of vertical walls inside the camper will make it seem more open
    > and allow more natural light, save weight, allow easier airflow

-   Put table top on interior roof with fold-out leg. To use table, just
    > grab tabletop off roof, clip into two points on the interior,
    > extend leg, and you have a table (table top can be foam wrapped in
    > vinyl or doorskin for light weight+rigidity)

-   Interior window into truck cab

-   Water level indicator for water tanks

-   Use inline fuses rather than fuse box when it makes sense

-   Windows should have mesh screen and a sun-blocking sliding panel

-   "Locking drawers" so they don't slide around

-   Slide-out bread board

-   Tip-out tray in front of sink to use up little bit of space where
    > full drawer won't go

-   Better to get a fridge that doesn't need to be level and doesn't
    > need ventilation

-   If you were to make a pop-up, shocks could help raise it
    > automatically

-   Two 10gal propane tanks on a sliding tray will make it so you can
    > switch which tank you are using and keep using one while you get
    > the other one filled so the truck is never without propane. (You
    > could also wait until you\'re out and then drive to a place to
    > exchange one tank)

-   Use space under floor for a slide out storage tray at the door for
    > dirty gear

-   Exterior clean water spigot so you can get drinking water, wash
    > things off, shower (if not showering indoors)

-   "Wildlands" door has 2-piece, is nice. Teardrop campers may have
    > smaller doors. But think about what you want to get in and out;
    > will a whole bike fit? Where's the kayak going?

-   "Front mud room" can just be a plastic bin with a lid, or maybe a
    > plastic bin with the front face cut off so you can throw your
    > boots in it. Plastic tray on floor when walk in can collect
    > initial water, can plop it on top of mud room bin after removing
    > boots

-   Make the bench seats open-face and under it is storage. Use aluminum
    > to construct the seat top so it's strong enough for sitting with
    > the face open.

-   12V fan in top corner of box for breeze

-   Mount for speaker on wall

-   LED lights on ceiling

-   Bendable LED light on wall

-   Think again about marine interiors, doors, hinges, slides, latches,
    > locks, netting

-   Think about storage: pantry, 4-season clothes, 4-season gear,
    > cooler, cooktop, pots, pans, cups, plates, utensils, cutting
    > board, batteries, electrical panel, DC-DC battery charger, solar
    > generator, power inverter, cell booster, starlink, heater, water
    > heater, water tanks, sink, toilet, shower, trash can, compost,
    > laundry, boots, jackets, laptop/tech gear, outdoor tools, power
    > tools, woodwork tools, truck repair tools

-   If installing an A/C, think about putting the vent high so the cool
    > air comes down. Want it in bed? Maybe fan blowing it up?

-   Think about accessories: 110V, 12V, USB, light switches

-   I didn't think about it before but I might be able to wire up the
    > DC-DC battery charger to the alternator so I can just use the
    > truck's engine/alternator as a generator to charge the battery
    > bank

    -   Look up max amperage usable when car is parked or driving

    -   Consider upgrading the alternator, cost would effectively
        > replace a generator. Maybe look into efficiency, truck might
        > be too inefficient at idle, risk running out of gas when
        > remote

-   Have a main battery/electircal shutoff switch for emergencies

-   Have a fire extinguisher

-   Have a way to tell when water is running low

-   Have a way to tell when propane is running low, or have two small
    > tanks, or one big tank and one small reserve tank (you'd only
    > really need it for heating food or emergency heat, and I can be
    > 4-season equipped to stretch it)

-   Be able to carry a jerry can of water or similar into a truck stop
    > to fill up on water and bring back to the truck to fill up

    -   Collapsible plastic large water container?

-   Be able to carry poop, pee, and gray water, out of the truck and
    > dump in a public toilet or porta potty

-   Make the camper as wide as the mirrors; if the mirrors fit, the
    > camper fits

-   Look up typical size limits for parking structures, drive throughs

-   Get windows with hidden or removable bug screens so it doesn't
    > obscure my view

-   Aluminum honeycomb is both lighter and stronger than sheet aluminum,
    > though thicker

-   Large-scale water purifier for refreshing water tank from
    > questionable sources

-   Think about venting the heat from the fridge, possibly insulating
    > the fridge

-   Rear of camper could hang over the tailgate, or angle out diagonally

-   Using aluminum (or steel?) angle iron on the external edges could be
    > both an exoskeleton and armor for tree branches

-   Corners of box don't have to be 90 degrees, could instead use a 45
    > degree corner so it's blunted but maybe stronger? Maybe takes hits
    > better since not a sharp edge?

-   Think about an awning before committing to exterior design

-   Tub floor to contain water

-   Interior walls could be lined with fabric, but then how do you clean
    > it?

-   Think about maybe having fixed in place windows and ventilation
    > somehow else

-   Emergency exits: what if someone blocks the rear door?

-   For storage, could build a sliding track door for cabinets instead
    > of opening-out doors

-   Cabinets can have slots to reconfigure shelves. Tracks?

-   Table could have leafs to open up wider

-   Probably better to keep the batteries inside the truck than outside;
    > could mount under the bed but would need to insulate and armor,
    > check how truck bottoms out

-   Heated floors??

-   Put aluminum panel on floor, put ice cubes?? Cool feet, whole body
    > stays cool?

-   Bed extends out over kitchen which is front of truck bed; could just
    > move a whole panel in place, or use sliders or something

-   Remember that you want a pass-through in the front of the truck too!

    -   Build in a removable door/window

    -   Don't place anything in middle front lower part of truck?

    -   Is that where the sink is??

-   Some people make a "garage" which is accessed from outside with
    > access to an inside storage compartment

-   Roof stuff

    -   Starlink

    -   Solar

    -   Vent sunroof (maybe don't get one if other vents exist? helps
        > with light/air but is a thermal suck)

-   If the bed slides out into the camper, then I don\'t even need a
    > very long or tall cabover. Just make it as tall as I need to stand
    > up, and build the bed to slide out for sleeping. I should have
    > plenty of headroom in the middle of the camper

-   If the windows are at the top, and so is the bed, I should always
    > have a view, and the floor can be storage for better weight
    > distribution

-   If the middle is the pass through, maybe make a table top right
    > under the pass through?

-   Wire up the trailer lights to the slide-in camper so you get rear
    > lights

-   Get a second backup camera, set up a quick-connect so a second
    > backup camera can work from the camper, or just reinstall the
    > backup camera to the bumper

-   Indoor/Outdoor thermometer

-   Sideways-oriented cooktop allows for more counter space

-   Building out the shell with an inside that has a million mounting
    > brackets allows me to change the internal layout later on. The
    > only thing that needs to stay out are the windows and the ports
    > for liquid, electrical, propane, etc

-   Can make a dinette seat that folds up to reveal a toilet (or
    > storage)

-   [*https://helinox.com/products/sunset-chair?variant=44571752759470*](https://helinox.com/products/sunset-chair?variant=44571752759470)

-   Create a "shower tub" - a tub that can come out and have a shower
    > curtain around/inside it, so you can take a shower, then dump the
    > gray water.

    -   This could be where you put wet or muddy items.

    -   Maybe have a small folding metal stand inside so you can raise
        > gear off the bottom so it dries out better

    -   Maybe have a drying rack above it for wet or washed clothes,
        > towels

    -   Maybe have this built into the truck as a "wet bath", and have a
        > water drain with a drain plug and mesh to prevent bugs getting
        > in (mud daubers!)

-   Wherever there is an external access panel door, make sure it has a
    > water-tight rubber seal

-   Cargo netting to stuff... stuff

-   Build air ducting into the camper for both air conditioning and
    > heating

-   Build a cover for the rear of the air conditioner, to seal in heat,
    > protect the fins from damage, eliminate dust entry, and make the
    > unit look more visually pleasing

SO COOL BUT UNNECESSARY

-   The entire back wall lifts up and out on shocks (or out and down?)
    > to expose the camper for full patio mode. Maybe both ways?? Up so
    > you can be protected from the rain, Down so you can have an
    > extremely unnecessary patio. Screen door/shade to protect from
    > bugs.

-   "Burning Man Mode": Seals unit but leaves air filters in place where
    > ventilation needed to prevent dust incursion. Windows covered by
    > reflective panels to prevent heat. Electric fans that
    > automatically kick in for ventilation. A/C. Sensitive parts not
    > exposed to prevent corrosion. All exterior panels are water/dust
    > tight. Sun shade mode. Can cover with aluminet.

-   Boot and jacket mud room entrance

-   Disassemble the walls and interior.

    -   The bottom can be a platform with channels around it

    -   Each wall can slot into the bottom channel, and into each
        > adjoining wall

    -   Clamp hinges can lock all the pieces together
