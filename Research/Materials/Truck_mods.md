## Tires

-   Type

    -   P (Passenger)

        -   4-6 ply

        -   lighter loads, smoother ride

        -   when p-metric tires are mounted on a truck (or an SUV) their load calculation must be reduced by 9 percent (a difference of more than 350 pounds per tire)

    -   LT (Light Truck)

        -   8-10 ply

        -   reinforced sidewalls, heavy duty, stiffer ride

-   Load Range

    -   SL

        -   4-ply, 36psi, 44lbs weight, 1,477lbs load

        -   normal road conditions, quieter, smoother ride, fuel efficient, cheaper, thinner

    -   XL

        -   4-ply, 41psi

        -   handles heavier loads than SL

    -   C

        -   6-ply, 35-50psi, 1760-2270lbs load

        -   normal road conditions, smoother ride

    -   D

        -   8-ply, 60psi, 1925 lbs load

    -   E

        -   10-ply, 65-80psi, 52lbs weight, 2470-3415lbs load

        -   heavy-duty and towing, louder, not fuel efficient, expensive, thicker

-   Load Index

    -   100: 1,764 lbs

    -   108: 2,205 lbs

    -   112: 2,469 lbs

    -   118: 2,910 lbs

-   Notes

    -   "If you don\'t exceed the rear GAWR of your F-150, then you gain nothing by replacing P-Series XL (extra load that are standard on my F-150) with LT tires. My stock P-series tires have more weight capacity at 44 PSI than normal Load Range C LT tires at max 50 PSI."

    -   Spreadsheet to calculate new tire sizes/rim sizes

    -   "We got right to work setting this truck up with Halo Lifts 2\" Spacers, then we swapped those out for Halo Lifts Boss Coilovers, Boss Rear Shocks and Icon Upper Control Arms. On top of that, we added Method Wheels and BFG KO2 Tires"

    -   [*https://www.stage3motorsports.com/Stage-3s-2015-F150-3-5L-EcoBoost-XLT-Projects-Leveling-Wheels-Tires.html*](https://www.stage3motorsports.com/Stage-3s-2015-F150-3-5L-EcoBoost-XLT-Projects-Leveling-Wheels-Tires.html)

    -   "In order to give this F150 some off road prowess without going overboard, we reached for our Boss Trail Package 2 and added some new Method NV wheels and a set of 305/65R18 BFG KO2 Tires"

        -   "Before we set up our 2015 F150 XLT with a Boss Trail Package, we first had it sitting on a Halo Lifts 2-Inch Leveling Kit to help us grab a little extra clearance in the wheel wells and to bring up the front ride height.  This pair of strut spacers and hardware adds two inches of ride height to the front of our truck which provides more clearance for big tires while getting rid of most of the truck\'s factory rake. Even though this kit wasn\'t installed for long, it was a solid system that makes for a cheap and easy way to fit larger wheels and tires.  2004-2017 F150 Halo Lifts 2\" Leveling Kit"

        -   "Our 2015 F150 XLT Project Truck was always destined to be a fun trail truck that also drove well on the street and could tow and haul when needed. Keeping in mind that we needed this truck to do a bit of everything, we grabbed a Boss Trail Suspension Package 2. This awesome suspension overhaul includes a set of Halo Lifts Boss 2.0 Coilovers, Halo Lifts Boss 2.0 Rear Shocks, a ReadyLift 3\" Rear Block, and ICON Upper Control Arms which gave our truck excellent on-road ride quality and much better off-road performance and handling over the factory suspension components. We even splurged a little and got the coilovers a white spring and both the rear shocks and front coilover bodies Halo Lift\'s Carbon WeatherWrap which gave all the dampers a great look with our white and black styling.[ ](https://www.stage3motorsports.com/S3M-1516TRAIL2-2015-2016-F150-Stage-3-BOSS-Trail-Suspension-Pack-2.html)[***2015-2017 F150 S3M Boss Trail Suspension Package 2***](https://www.stage3motorsports.com/S3M-1516TRAIL2-2015-2016-F150-Stage-3-BOSS-Trail-Suspension-Pack-2.html)"

        -   "The Method NV wheels we threw on our 2015 XLT Project Truck looked awesome, but the +18mm offset kept them tucked in the wheel wells pretty tightly. Since we wanted a wider stance and some extra clearance for our UCAs, we grabbed a full set of four BORA 1.75\" Wheel Spacers. BORA\'s spacers are made out of extremely strong billet aluminum and drop right onto your F150\'s hubs without modifications in their 1.75\" size (1.25\" spacers and below require stud trimming). BORA\'s spacers worked exactly as advertised and gave our truck an awesome stance and more horizontal clearance in no time.[ ](https://www.stage3motorsports.com/BORA-F1501-75X4-2004-2015-F150-BORA-6x135mm-1-75-Wheel-Spacers-Four.html)[***2015-2017 F150 BORA 1.75-inch Wheel Spacers***](https://www.stage3motorsports.com/BORA-F1501-75X4-2004-2015-F150-BORA-6x135mm-1-75-Wheel-Spacers-Four.html)"

        -   "Now that our 2015 F150 Project Truck had new Method wheels, it was time to find a solid set of tires to wrap them in.  Our tires of choice were 305/65R18 BFG KO2 All-Terrains.  The BFG KO2\'s are a fan favorite in the off road world and it\'s not hard to see why. With their aggressive tread design, tough sidewalls and low road noise, these tires are a perfect fit for any truck that needs to take you to work and also get you out on the trails.[ ](https://www.stage3motorsports.com/BFG08017-30565R18-BF-Goodrich-All-Terrain-TA-KO2-Tire.html)[***305/65R18 BFG KO2 Tires***](https://www.stage3motorsports.com/BFG08017-30565R18-BF-Goodrich-All-Terrain-TA-KO2-Tire.html)"

-   Complete lift kit

    -   Front 3" lift kit: [*https://freedomoffroadusa.com/3-front-strut-spacer-3-rear-lift-blocks-w-u-bolts-front-upper-control-arms-fo-f604-3al-fo-f704fu/*](https://freedomoffroadusa.com/3-front-strut-spacer-3-rear-lift-blocks-w-u-bolts-front-upper-control-arms-fo-f604-3al-fo-f704fu/)

-   Upper control arms

    -   "We wanted to make sure we increased the articulation of our F150 to get the most out of our Icon coilovers without destroying the truck\'s suspension geometry. Upper control arms are the most effective way to do this, so we tossed on a pair of BDS arms that we knew would be up to the task. These BDS UCAs combine an extremely strong tubular steel construction with an uprated MOOG Ball Joint that\'s more durable than the stock ball joint and is installed in an indexed housing to allow for more deflection and articulation in our front suspension.[ ](https://www.stage3motorsports.com/123253-2004-2018-F150-BDS-Tubular-Ball-Joint-Upper-Control-Arms.html)[***04-18 F150 BDS Tubular Ball Joint Upper Control Arms***](https://www.stage3motorsports.com/123253-2004-2018-F150-BDS-Tubular-Ball-Joint-Upper-Control-Arms.html)"

        -   1.5\" stainless steel uniballs provide greater articulation, increased durability and eliminates binding found in OE style ball joints.

-   Strut tower spacers

-   Extended struts (front)

    -   Front Bilstein 6112: [*https://www.stage3motorsports.com/47-256958-15-20-F150-4WD-Bilstein-6112-Front-Leveling-Kit.html*](https://www.stage3motorsports.com/47-256958-15-20-F150-4WD-Bilstein-6112-Front-Leveling-Kit.html)

-   Extended shocks

-   U-bolts (???)

-   Wheels/Tires

    -   "The color combo is a great fit for this truck and the 17x8.5\" sizing allows us to fit a 34\" tire with lots of delightfully squishy sidewall for airing down on the trail"

    -   "decided to mix things up with a set of 315/70R17 BFGoodrich KO2 All Terrains. These KO2\'s are an extremely popular tire in the off road community and that\'s not by accident. They are comfortable and relatively quiet on the street while still being capable and durable in the most technical terrain making them an ideal tire for any overland build. Now, with these tires being essentially 34\" we did have to get creative with trimming inside the fenders and along the bottoms of the factory flares to prevent rubbing. Even though it\'s not just simple \"bolt-on\" fitment, the look is certainly worth it!"
