### Propane

-   Propex: [*https://www.propexheatsource.com/heaters/hs2000-furnace/*](https://www.propexheatsource.com/heaters/hs2000-furnace/)

    -   Has a thermostat

    -   12V Power draw: 1.9A continous running, 0.04A standby

    -   60 CFM

    -   Heat output: 6483 BTU

    -   Make sure to buy a North American version for the correct gas fitting

    -   Exhaust Flue Length: Total combined length must not exceed 4 meters and the inlet pipe should be slightly longer than the exhaust to balance the burner.

    -   Outlets: The maximum recommended is 3, providing the total combined length of ducting is no longer than 5 metres and the maximum length to the first outlet should not exceed 1.5m.

### Diesel/Gas

    -   "The Eberspacher B2L is engineered to operate in extreme conditions and high altitudes. It can operate in temperatures as low as -46°C / - 50°F and at altitudes of up to 18K feet.  This is possible thanks to its integrated altitude sensor, and unlike earlier models there is no additional wiring or installation required for high altitude operation."

    -   "With the built-in barometer, the Velit air heater has the industry\'s highest elevation rating (16000ft) so you will have warm air wherever you go. The barometer inside the controller senses the air pressure and adjusts the air-fuel mix ratio accordingly to provide better high-elevation performance and reduce carbon build-up."

    -   Airtronic S3 B2L

        -   12V, 11W low, 26W high, \<80W starting

        -   2K BTU

        -   0.14 -- 0.26 liters/hour

        -   -40 to +50 Celsius

        -   2.5 Kg

        -   310x115x122

        -   100 kg/hr heat flow rate

        -   Flexible installation with 90° tilt possible to either side

-   Air

    -   Exhaust

        -   The exhaust outlet must be arranged so as to prevent any penetration of exhaust fumes into the vehicle interior through the ventilation system, warm air intakes or open windows.

    -   Combustion air intake

        -   The air for the heater\'s combustion chamber may not be drawn in from the vehicle\'s passenger compartment. The air intake must be arranged or protected in such a way that it cannot be blocked by other objects.

    -   Hot air intake

        -   The hot air supply must consist of fresh air or circulated air and must be drawn in from a clean area, which cannot be contaminated by exhaust fumes from the engine, the combustion heater or any other source in the vehicle.

-   Someone has suggested that at high altitude, bigger ducting (75+) is better, because it lets more oxygen in, otherwise you can have overheating issues

-   It occurred to me you need battery to operate the heater... in Winter... so what happens when you run out of battery, and how are you going to charge your battery in Winter? Solar? Fat chance.  Alternator? Not without a second one. So shore power or genny would be the only options.

    -   It could be that propane heating is just more reliable in winter, because I don't need a fan to run a Mr. Buddy.

        -   So seriously consider a spot outside to put a 20lb propane tank.

        -   And estimate how long I could run a heater on it, compared to my big-ass battery bank with the Espar or Velit.
