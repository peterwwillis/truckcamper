# Materials / Research / Electrical

## Planning

This website has a great tool to plan out your electrical system: [*https://faroutride.com/van-electrical-calculator/*](https://faroutride.com/van-electrical-calculator/)


## Batteries

### Notes

-   [*https://www.truckcamperadventure.com/how-to-properly-charge-an-rv-lithium-battery/*](https://www.truckcamperadventure.com/how-to-properly-charge-an-rv-lithium-battery/)

-   Do not keep at 100 percent charge! Degrades battery!

-   Use a "Lithium battery" charger setting to charge at 14.6V

-   Charge at 80% of battery capacity amperage, or suggested amp rate of the battery

-   Use an "Anderson plug" to quick-disconnect the alternator from the DC-DC charger

-   [*https://www.truckcamperadventure.com/ditching-the-generator-for-the-alternator/*](https://www.truckcamperadventure.com/ditching-the-generator-for-the-alternator/)

    -   Goes into use of 24v system and a second alternator


## Charger/Inverter

-   On air conditioners, suggestion not to use too big of an inverter if also using AC. *"Because the air conditioner increases power demand on the electrical system, we'd recommend selecting a 2000W inverter/charger. It's possible to go with a 3000W inverter/charger, but be aware that this might overload the system during peak power (e.g. when the inverter and the air conditioner are both running simultaneously at max power)."* (https://faroutride.com/12v-air-con/)


## Generator

Generators can be powered by natural gas, propane, or gasoline. Some can power a 'house
system' via an RV-style outlet plug, and some can output DC power to charge batteries.

-   Check what outputs the generator has (12v, 120v, pure sine wave, etc)


## Cell booster

There are lots of cell boosters out there, and their designs vary.

In general you should only expect about 1 signal bar difference. More is possible but
rare. Cell boosters are about minor changes in quality; if you have almost no signal,
they can give you just enough to send a text or call 911. If you have almost-high-speeds,
they can give you higher speed. But your location is going to make the biggest difference.

If there is no signal at all, don't expect the booster to work, as it needs to
receive a signal reliably. Move to a location that is higher elevation or more likely to
be within line of sight of a tower.

In general you probably want a WeBoost Car/RV style booster. They provide the most output
power legally available, and are decent quality. You can always change the antenna
yourself, and they come in models that take DC power (cigarette lighter).

A directional YAGI antenna will give you the best signal *if* you have line-of-sight to
a tower. Otherwise you want an omni-directional antenna.

An antenna mast will help you reach signals that may be too drowned out at your elevation.
Basically it helps you "jump over" obstacles in the way of the signal. An extendable flag
pole (such as ones from Harbor Freight) work great.

It's also important to place your external antenna away from the "interior antenna", or
the part that rebroadcasts the signal inside your camper. If these two antennas are too
close, they get cross-talk, which destroys the signal, and can temporarily disable the
booster. So place one antenna towards the front of your camper, the other towards the
back on the opposite side. If you need coverage outside the camper, that's more
complicated.

## Solar

### Notes

-   One thing to keep in mind is wiring together a lot of solar panels has a lot of considerations:

    -   Are you getting 12V, 24V, a range?

    -   How many amps?

    -   Size and run of cables?

    -   If you have different panels connected together, you end up getting the lowest voltage of all of them, which is bad

    -   You can run multiple separate solar controllers so that you can keep your solar panels separate and get the most voltage from each of them

        -   One controller for roof panels

        -   One controller for the foldable panels
