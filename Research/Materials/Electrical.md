## Batteries

-   NOTES:

    -   [*https://www.truckcamperadventure.com/how-to-properly-charge-an-rv-lithium-battery/*](https://www.truckcamperadventure.com/how-to-properly-charge-an-rv-lithium-battery/)

    -   Do not keep at 100 percent charge!

    -   Use a "Lithium battery" charger setting to charge at 14.6V

    -   Charge at 80% of battery capacity amperage, or suggested amp rate of the battery

    -   Use an "Anderson plug" to quick-disconnect the alternator from the DC-DC charger

    -   [*https://www.truckcamperadventure.com/ditching-the-generator-for-the-alternator/*](https://www.truckcamperadventure.com/ditching-the-generator-for-the-alternator/)

        -   Goes into use of 24v system and a second alternator

## Charger/Inverter

-   "Because the air conditioner increases power demand on the electrical system, we'd recommend selecting a 2000W inverter/charger. It's possible to go with a 3000W inverter/charger, but be aware that this might overload the system during peak power (e.g. when the inverter and the air conditioner are both running simultaneously at max power)." (https://faroutride.com/12v-air-con/)

## Generator

-   [*https://www.campervan-hq.com/products/ecoflow-smart-generator-dual-fuel*](https://www.campervan-hq.com/products/ecoflow-smart-generator-dual-fuel)

-   NOTES

    -   Check what outputs the generator has (12v, 120v, pure sine wave, etc)

## Cell booster

-   [*https://www.campervan-hq.com/collections/cell-phone-signal-boosters*](https://www.campervan-hq.com/collections/cell-phone-signal-boosters)

## Solar

-   One thing to keep in mind is wiring together a lot of solar panels has a lot of considerations

    -   Are you getting 12V, 24V, a range?

    -   How many amps?

    -   Size and run of cables?

    -   If you have different panels connected together, you end up getting the lowest voltage of all of them, which is bad

    -   You can run multiple separate solar controllers so that you can keep your solar panels separate and get the most voltage from each of them

        -   One controller for roof panels

        -   One controller for the foldable panels
