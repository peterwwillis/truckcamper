## Materials / Research / Doors

-   Very expensive, \$1000+ (unless on sale!)

-   Screen door would be a great idea

-   Window for both looking out and to get more light in. Can be skinny and long (vertical)

-   Multiple deadbolts for security

    -   Maybe make them clamping latches so it tightly pulls the door closed. Better for when you're bumping down a trail, or it's winter and you want to tightly seal out the cold

    -   Double seals!

-   Design the entrance so the water runs outside if water leaks in

-   Some doors have an integrated long handle (to pull yourself up) and waste bin

-   Four hinges are better than two

-   Setting the door into the wall will make it so a bear (or human?) has to dig into the wall to get leverage on the door.

    -   Metal flashing important to reinforce the edge of the door from attacks, as well as keep it rigid for holding up the door, and to reinforce the joint when tightly sealing it for winter

-   "High-security" metal screen

    -   "The screen door features a stainless steel powder-coated #6 woven mesh with .040 wire. #6 was chosen because it is the largest mesh that a grizzly cannot get a claw into. The door frame is recessed to foil prying claws or tools."

-   Sliding door??

-   Make door corners rounded to avoid point loading on corners/edges
