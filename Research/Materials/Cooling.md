# Materials / Research / Cooling

In general, cooling options comes down to:

 - Passive cooling
 - Fans
 - Personal air conditioners
 - Window air conditioners
 - RV air conditioners
 - 'Special' ACs

## Passive cooling

The sun's rays heat the camper through radiation. If you can reflect away the radiation,
you reduce the heat.

### Reflection

Reflectex or another reflective surface is good for reflecting away this radiant heat.

[Aluminet](https://shadeclothstore.com/product-category/shade-cloth/aluminet-shade-cloth/)
 is a reflective woven cloth that reflects heat. It comes in different grades. It is
lightweight and can help reduce temperatures.

Completely opaque cloths perform the best at preventing radiant heating on something
behind it. However, the cloth must be separated from what is behind it, so that airflow
can carry away the heat radiating off the cloth itself. If the cloth is touching the thing
you want to cool, the temperature will just transfer directly through conduction. Cloth
that reflects heat does not need to be separated, because it is effectively bouncing the
light off, versus an opaque cloth which is absorbing it.

### Colors

White paint absorbs less radiant light than other paint colors. Take a laser temperature
sensor to a car parking lot on a very hot day, and measure the temperature of all the cars.
White cars will have the lowest surface temperature.

### Windows

If you have nothing else, two big windows on either side of the camper can allow a cross
breeze. But without steadily moving air outside, it won't cool the inside air, and most
likely hot stale air will build up in the camper.

## Fans

Some people say they don't need an air conditioner, that a fan is good enough most of the
time. But the way you have a fan set up makes a big difference.

 - Having two separate high-power ceiling fans, one set to exhaust and one set to intake,
   seems to produce the highest volume of airflow through the camper. People I've talked
   to say this is plenty to keep the camper cool.

 - One fan set to exhaust, with side windows cracked open, creates a cross breeze which is
   pretty effective at cooling the camper.

## Personal air conditioners

There are small portable air conditioners available now. However, they are expensive, do
not put out much cooling, require a relatively large amount of power, and often have
problems like leaking. For the same amount of energy you can get much more cooling out
of a window AC.

## Window AC units

### Can pull less power than RV ACs

No professional camper vendors will install window AC units, and will claim when you ask them
that window AC units aren't as efficient as a more expensive RV air conditioner.

However, this is simply false. There is no magic behind an air conditioner, they all work
the same way.

Basically, an AC takes power in, uses it to power a compressor which operates on
a closed system of pipes, gases and coils, and they use power to take in hot air, blow it
over coils which are cold, transfer the heat through a series of pipes to a set of fins on
the outside of the AC, and blow the now-cooler air back in.

Some RV ACs can use DC power instead of AC power. If the power source is DC (like
a battery array in your camper), then using a DC power supply is more efficient than
converting it to AC (or vice versa). So the claim is, using a DC air conditioner is always
more efficient. But the loss of converting DC to AC (say, through a power inverter) is
only between 10-20%. This is significant, but it's not the whole story.

But efficiency isn't the whole story. The air conditioner is rated in BTUs (British
Thermal Units). This is an approximation of how much air it can cool. Since it takes more
power to cool more air, it's also an approximation of how much power is required to cool
the air.

And again this is an approximation. The amount of power used to create those BTUs of
cooling depends on the design of the air conditioner - specifically its compressor(s) and
fans. Different air conditioners use more efficient parts so they may draw different
amounts of power even if they're rated for the same BTUs.

Newer air conditioners also use a method called "dual-inverter compressor", which is
basically just a compressor that can run at different speeds, rather than one speed. Older
air conditioners had dumb compressors that were either "on at full speed", or off. Newer
air conditioners *sometimes* have compressors that vary their speed depending on how much
cooling is needed. So dual-inverter air conditioners can draw less power.

Therefore, "AC efficiency" is complex. It depends on:

 - BTU rating
 - Compressor design
 - Power supply (AC/DC)
 - Fan, electronics, etc design

If you are boondocking and want to run an AC, the most important factor isn't
"efficiency", it's how much power is needed to run your AC. So look up the air
conditioner's actual power draw, and calculate how long that will last.

Some of the lowest-rated window unit ACs (~5000 BTU) pull only about 42 watts. Even with
a loss of ~15% (from converting your battery's 12 DC to 115VAC), that is 48.3 watts.

But the smallest rooftop DC-powered RV ACs are 75000 BTUs. They pull around 65 watts
minimum. These also don't have dual-inverter technology.

Therefore, a window AC unit can draw less power than the "efficient" DC-powered RV ACs, so it
will last longer on your battery.

Not only will the window unit AC last longer on your battery, they are 10x less expensive
than an RV AC. Window unit ACs cost around $120 and up, while RV ACs start at $1000.

A downside of the cheaper window unit ACs is they are noisy, and they don't use
dual-inverter technology. More expensive window unit ACs (~$450) are actually very quiet,
and some do come with dual-inverter technology.

## RV ACs

RV ACs are either AC or DC powered, and usually installed on the roof. They tend to
be expensive, starting around $1000.

Some ACs can be installed largely inside the vehicle, as under a bench. These are more
common in van conversions.

## Special ACs

There exist some specialty air conditioners designed for industrial and other
applications. I have no documentation of these being used in campers, so there may be
challenges to overcome, like building your own housings and control modules.

However, some can run on higher voltage DC (48V), which makes it more efficient if you
run a higher voltage house electrical system. They may also be rated for lower BTUs, which
means they may draw less power, extending the amount of time you have on your battery.
However, keep in mind that the less BTUs it puts out, the more it will have to work to
cool your vehicle in intense heat.

-   If going with window AC, maybe build in ducting to reach the cabover bed?
