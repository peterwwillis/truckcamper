# Research / Materials / Cooling

In general, cooling options come down to:

 - Passive cooling
 - Fans
 - Air conditioners

Keep in mind that **insulation** plays the biggest role in *how much* cooling you
need. Cooling reduces temperature, and insulation prevents the need to reduce the
temperature. The better insulation you have, the less need for cooling (or heating).
However, no insulation can completely prevent the temperature from eventually
changing, so some kind of cooling is important if you're going to be in a very
hot place for a long time.


## Passive cooling


### Reflection

The sun's rays heat the camper through radiation. If you can reflect away the radiation,
you reduce the heat.

Reflectex or another reflective surface is good for reflecting away this radiant heat.

[Aluminet](https://shadeclothstore.com/product-category/shade-cloth/aluminet-shade-cloth/)
 is a reflective woven cloth that reflects heat. It comes in different grades. It is
lightweight and can help reduce temperatures.

### Absorbtion

#### Shade cloth

Completely opaque cloths perform the best at preventing radiant heating on something
behind it. However, the cloth must be separated from what is behind it, so that airflow
can carry away the heat radiating off the cloth itself.

If the cloth is touching the thing you want to cool, the temperature will just transfer
directly through conduction. Cloth that reflects heat does not need to be separated,
because it is effectively bouncing the light off, versus an opaque cloth which is absorbing it.

#### Colors

White absorbs less light [and thus heat] than other colors. Take a laser temperature
sensor to a car parking lot on a very hot day, and measure the temperature of all the cars.
White cars will have the lowest surface temperature.

### Windows

If you have nothing else, two big windows on either side of the camper can allow a cross
breeze. But without steadily moving air outside, it won't cool the inside air, and most
likely hot stale air will build up in the camper.


## Fans

Some people say they don't need an air conditioner, that a fan is good enough most of the
time. But the way you have a fan set up makes a big difference.

 - Having two separate high-power ceiling fans, one set to exhaust and one set to intake,
   seems to produce the highest volume of airflow through the camper. People I've talked
   to say this is plenty to keep the camper cool.

 - One fan set to exhaust, with side windows cracked open, creates a cross breeze which is
   pretty effective at cooling the camper.


## Air conditioners

Keep in mind that most air conditioners will pull a significant amount of energy when they
start. If your power supply can't provide enough power at start time, you may need to buy
a "slow-start" device, which regulates the power drawn from the appliance to keep it from
going over your max.

Air conditioners with "dual-inverter" technology tend not to need slow-start devices as
they will gradually ramp up their power use. These are fairly rare outside residential
ACs.


### Personal air conditioners

There are small portable air conditioners available now. However, they are expensive, do
not put out much cooling, require a relatively large amount of power, and often have
problems like leaking.

For close to the same amount of energy you can get much more cooling out of a window unit
AC for less money. (you want more BTUs to cool a larger space, otherwise you will have
to run the AC longer, which uses more energy)

### Window AC units

#### Why consider a window AC unit?

No professional camper vendors will install window AC units. They will tell you
that window AC units aren't as efficient as an RV AC.

However, this is misleading. Efficiency isn't the only consideration.

#### How AC works

All ACs work basically the same way:
- Energy (electricity) is taken in to operate a compressor
- Compressor raises the pressure and temperature of a refrigerant gas
- Gas goes to the condenser coil where it is converted to a liquid
- Refrigerant travels back indoors and enters the evaporator coil
- Liquid refrigerant evaporates, cooling the indoor coil
- A fan blows hot indoor air across the cold evaporator coil
- Heat from the indoor air is absorbed through the coil into the refrigerant
- The now cooler air is pumped back inside
- The heated evaporated gas is sent back outside to the compressor
- Heat is released into the outdoor air as the refrigerant returns to a liquid state

#### AC vs DC power

Some RV ACs can use DC power instead of AC power. If the power source is DC (like
a battery array in your camper), then using a DC power supply is more efficient than
converting it to AC (or vice versa).

The loss of converting DC to AC (say, through a power inverter) is between 10-20%.
So people will claim that using a DC air conditioner is always more efficient.
However, this isn't the whole story of how 'efficient' an AC is.

#### BTUs

The air conditioner is rated in BTUs (British Thermal Units). This is an *approximation* of
how much energy it takes to cool the air. Two ACs with the same rated BTUs may perform
quite differently.

The amount of power used for cooling depends on the design of the air conditioner.
Specifically its compressor(s) and fans. Different air conditioners use more efficient parts,
so they may draw different amounts of power, even if they're rated for the same BTUs.

#### Compressor design

Newer air conditioners also use a technology called a "dual-inverter compressor", which is
basically just a compressor that can run at different speeds, rather than one speed. Older
air conditioners had dumb compressors that were either "on at full speed", or off.
Dual-inverter compressors vary their speed depending on how much cooling is needed. So
dual-inverter air conditioners can draw less power.


#### "Efficiency"

Therefore, "AC efficiency" is complex. It depends on:

 - BTU rating
 - Compressor design
 - Power supply (AC/DC)
 - Fan, electronics, etc design

#### Total power draw

If you are boondocking and want to run an AC, the most important factor isn't
"efficiency". It's how much total power is drawn in order to run your AC. So look up the air
conditioner's actual power draw, and calculate how long that will last you.

Some of the lowest-rated window unit ACs (~5000 BTU) pull only about 42 watts. Even with
a loss of ~15% (from converting your battery's 12V DC to 120V AC), that is 48.3 watts.
(compared to 12V DC that would be around 480 watts)

But the smallest rooftop DC-powered RV ACs are ~75000 BTUs. They pull around 650 watts
minimum. These also don't have dual-inverter technology.

Therefore, a window AC unit can draw less power than the "efficient" DC-powered RV ACs, so it
can last longer on your battery.

They are also 10x less expensive than an RV AC. Window unit ACs cost around $120 and up, while
RV ACs start at $1000.

A downside of the cheaper window unit ACs is they are noisy, and they don't use
dual-inverter technology. More expensive window unit ACs (~$450) are actually very quiet,
and some do come with dual-inverter technology.

### RV ACs

RV ACs are either AC or DC powered, and usually installed on the roof. They tend to
be expensive, starting around $1000.

A few models are also designed for higher-voltage 24V and 48V DC power, which is more efficient.

These tend to draw more power than a window AC due to their larger minimum BTU output. But
it depends a lot on the particular unit.

The lowest-drawing rooftop AC that I have found is the [Velit 2000r
Mini](https://velitcamping.com/products/velit-2000r-mini-rooftop-air-conditioner-12-48v).
It claims to  draw "as low as" 250 Watts @ 12V DC, but "up to" 650 Watts @ 12V DC. If you can
keep it on low, this would be a lower draw than the most efficient window unit ACs. All other
commercial RV ACs I have found draw a *minimum* of 650 Watts. So if you really want a roof-mount
AC, the Velit appears to be the best value.

(It is, however, $1,470 on sale before shipping, whereas the window unit ACs can be had for
~$150; $1,320 can buy you a lot of batteries and solar panels!).

Some ACs can be installed largely inside the vehicle, as under a bench. These are more
common in van conversions.

### Special ACs

There exist some specialty air conditioners designed for industrial and other
applications. I have no documentation of these being used in campers, so there may be
challenges to overcome, like building your own housings and control modules.

However, some can run on higher voltage DC (48V), which makes it more efficient if you
run a higher voltage house electrical system.

They may also be rated for lower BTUs, which means they may draw less power, extending
the amount of time you have on your battery. However, keep in mind that the less BTUs it
 puts out, the more it will have to work to cool your vehicle in intense heat.

-   If going with window AC, maybe build in ducting to reach the cabover bed?
