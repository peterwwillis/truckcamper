## Water Tanks

### Storage

**Polyethylene camper van water tanks must be vented. **These fresh
water tanks are not designed to handle pressure or a vacuum. A vent is
necessary because as the tank is filled or emptied of its liquid an
equal proportion of air must be displaced simultaneously. Discharge of a
water tank without a vent would cause a vacuum to occur. A generally
accepted rule concerning vent size is that it should be the same size as
the tank's largest outlet.

**If using a translucent tank for fresh water, consider applying paint
to make the tank opaque to prevent algae formation due to exposure to
light.**

**Use thin elastomeric (not foam) strips on the tank to reduce vibration
and wear and create a tight fit.**

## Heated Water

There are heated water tanks and tankless options (on-demand).

Some people have installed the water heater outside (https://www.rvingknowhow.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Should-You-Consider-a-Tankless-Water-Heater-for-your-RV.webp), but that's probaly more for showering outside.
