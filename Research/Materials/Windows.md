# Research / Materials / Windows

## Commercial windows

Commercial windows tend to be pretty expensive. They can come in single-pane and
dual-pane. 

Arctic Tern are generally the best, as they are well designed and come with all
the features you could want.

-   Can DIY your own door

    -   Doors should have rounded corners to avoid point loading on edges/corners

-   For acrylic windows, can clean them if they get foggy or scratched ([*https://shop.nomadvanz.com/collections/windows/products/novus-acrylic-care*](https://shop.nomadvanz.com/collections/windows/products/novus-acrylic-care))



## DIY

You can also build your own windows. Windows are just a see-through material with a frame.
Their construction can get very complicated, but doesn't have to be.

-   Materials

    -   Acrylic / Plexiglass
        -   Cheap
        -   Lightweight
        -   Not as good insulation as glass
        -   17x stronger than traditional glass
        -   Clear acrylic is more transparent than glass!
        -   Do not show glare and reflections
        -   Different coatings available
        -   Easier to scratch

    -   Polycarbonate / Lexan
        -   250x stronger than traditional glass, 30x stronger than acrylic
        -   Just as clear as glass
        -   Structurally strong
        -   Different grades available

    -   Vinyl
        -   Cheap

    -   Laminated glass
        -   Increased strength but hard to cut

    -   Tempered glass
        -   Increased strength
        -   Prone to shattering

-   Potential problems
    -   Glass expands???

### Design ideas

    -   The walls on my camper will be 2-⅛" thick!! That means I can design a window that thick, like a triple-glazed!

    -   "Glazing compound -- Used to seal glass panes together into an airtight insulating unit. Look for high quality brands like DAP or OSI. Silicone or latex based compounds work well."

    -   "Glazing putty tape -- The putty tape creates an airtight seal around glass unit edges. Get the right thickness to match your window depth."

    -   " In all the dual-pane windows I\'ve worked with, the spacer is a permanent part of the installation. That is the professional way, and attention to that detail and the adhesive used determines success or failure. Silicone caulk isn\'t a structural material suited to be a glass separator."

    -   "\[Silicones\] have high gas permeability: at room temperature (25 °C), the permeability of silicone rubber for such gases as oxygen is approximately 400 times\[citation needed\] that of butyl rubber, making silicone useful for medical applications in which increased aeration is desired. Consequently, silicone rubbers cannot be used where gas-tight seals are necessary."

    -   "It\'s possible to make them yourself if you get the right materials. For spacers search in Amazon for \"Dual Seal Aluminum Spacer\". For the sealer use a PIB Primary seal tape that wraps around the top, outside edge, and bottom of the spacer. Search in Amazon for \"CRL Polyisobutylene Primary Seal\". This stuff remains flexible and is very tacky."

    -   "If you use Butyl Rubber around perimeter except a small part and use a heat lamp to heat interior section, then seal the short part, it will be like canning tomatoes. When it cools, a vacuum will be formed !"

    -   "Kind of tangential here but file this away as another approach: I built a skylight 40 years ago out of acrylic sheets (\"Plexiglass\") using acrylic solvent to bond the edges of the double-paned center portion. It\'s still sealed after all these years. I didn\'t take all the precautions that were possible - leak testing and using adhesive where leaks existed; back filling with Argon; **inserting gel to soak up moisture** etc etc."

    -   "Pella windows uses an installed window and then a panel that is installed like a storm window on the inside. The sides of the window has vents on each side high and low. No fogging with insulating qualities. The windows I had never fogged. If you have tools and some skills this could be attempted. Their gap was near 3/4\" but some insulating qualities could still be achieved in the space used for insulated panels."

    -   "using glass cleaner clean glass. Important!"


### Implementation notes

        -   " The sash of the window is the trick to this design. It acts as the spacer between the sheets of glass; it provides a place for the O-rings that seal the glass to the frame; it provides a place to add trim, which holds the glass in place; and it provides a structure that supports the glass."
