-   Arctic Tern Windows

    -   "Awning style windows allow for maximum ventilation. Double pane acrylic. 10 and 35 degrees open for the 300mm size. 20, 40, and 60 degrees for all other sizes. Semi-lock position that allows air in during stormy conditions. Blind and screen is included with window, comes with a fine mesh insect screen and blackout blind with reflective exterior. These can be used separately or together for infinite combinations of privacy and air. The blind also creates a second dead air space for maximum thermal efficiency in very cold conditions." -Tern Overland
