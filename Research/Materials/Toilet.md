# Research / Materials / Toilet


There are traditional "black tank" toilets, cassette toilets, and composting toilets.

## Black tank toilet

All the pee and poop is flushed with water into a black tank, separate from your gray
water and fresh water tanks.

This takes up extra space, weight, and must be dumped at approved RV dump stations
once full.

## Cassette toilet

Basically it's a black tank in small form. You remove the tank and empty it at a dump
station. These can be expensive.

## Composting toilet

Composting toilets are two separate containers for your pee and your poop.
The container for your poop needs a dry material added to absorb the poop's moisture, and
a small fan helps dry it faster and blows away any smell. You dump the pee into any place
pee is allowed (public toilets, dump stations) and the poop should go into a dump station.
Many people bag the poop and toss the bag in a dumpster, but the legality of that varies
by location. (Personally, I think if people can toss baby poop diapers in the dumpster,
they should be able to toss composted, bagged adult poop in the dumpster)

So basically it's like a more laborious cassette toilet. The major benefit to the
composting toilet, however, is that you can go a longer period without having to empty it.
It is also less smelly, as the majority of the smell from human waste is due to the poop
breaking down when it is wet.

The other big benefit is cost. You can build your own DIY composting toilet with a bucket,
a plastic bucket toilet seat, a urine diverter, a bottle (like a large laundry detergent
 bottle) and flexible hose. Typically the poop is kept in a plastic bag that fits in the
poop container, so you can bag it and toss it.

Commercial composting toilets range from relatively inexpensive, to expensive. Commercial
ones may come with more complex features like a crank that will mix the poop with the dry
material to help it compost better, but these can have problems.

So this is by far the cheapest option, more portable than anything else, and you can go
longer before needing to empty it.

One downside is the need to keep dry material to mix with the poop. Coir hair (coconut),
cedar chips, sawdust, hemp, etc are common options. You don't absolutely have to use it,
but your poop will get smelly without it.

## Notes

-   Fan for drying, smell ventilation

    -   [*https://compocloset.com/collections/accessories/products/replacement-fan-kit*](https://compocloset.com/collections/accessories/products/replacement-fan-kit)

    -   Make sure fan is low-energy and low-noise

    -   If using a fan for ventilation, an air intake is also useful

    -   For exhaust pipe, apply a bug screen

-   Grippy feet for toilet is useful

-   Shorter is better to stow away somewhere

-   Dry goods to add to solids
    -   Coir
