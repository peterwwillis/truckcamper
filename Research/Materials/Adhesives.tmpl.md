# Research / Materials / Adhesives

## Why you should investigate your adhesive

There are a ton of adhesives out there with a wide variety of applications.

Do not make the mistake of buying one adhesive because somebody said:
"Yeah, I really like *Manufacturer Name Here*, it works great".

Do all Toyota-brand cars work the same? A Toyota Corolla is pretty different
from a Toyota Tundra, isn't it? They're used for different jobs, so they're
built different. But they're both Toyotas.

Every manufacturer makes multiple adhesive products which have very
different use cases. They are made with different compounds, and made
to cure in different ways, so they can handle different situations
and different materials with different strengths/weaknesses.

Therefore you should pick a specific adhesive make/model that matches a
specific application. The environment you're applying it in, what materials
you're applying it to, what those materials will be doing, and what
weather it'll be doing it in.

Examples of the variety of differences in adhesives:

 - Some adhesives are designed to *be applied* in all weather, some only in
   a very specific temperature range.

 - Some adhesives are designed to *perform (after curing)* in all weather,
   some only work in a very specific temperature range.

 - Some can be applied to wet surfaces, some will be waterproof, some
   water resistant, some don't like water at all.

 - Some require water in order to cure, benefiting from light misting of
   the substrate; some don't work that way at all.

 - Some will work on many kinds of materials *except one or two*, some
   will only work well on a few materials.

 - Some may work with any form of a material (say, Extruded Polystyrene).
   Some may require sanding or peeling a protective film off the substrate
   in order to bond. Some might just melt the substrate no matter what.

 - Some can only be applied to porous substrates, some at least one porous
   substrate, some don't require any porous substrate.

 - Some grab the substrate immediately (no clamping required), some require
   minor clamping, some expand greatly requiring firm clamping.

 - Some resist UV, some don't.

 - Some may advertise a high strength bond, unless they get very hot,
   and then they lose most of their strength (but they don't advertise that!)

 - Some are very rigid when cured, some remain very flexible.

 - Some create hazardous VOCs, some don't.

 - Some adhesives may set up after 5 minutes, some after 45 minutes.

 - Some are good at gap filling, some bad at it.

 - Some expand, some contract, some stay the same.

 - Some will sag, bringing anything hanging on it down; some won't.

Etc, etc, etc...

In other words, never take an adhesive, or a use case, for granted.

Always check their technical data sheet to confirm that it works for
*your specific use case*.

If you're not sure about an adhesive, make a test piece, let it cure,
then inspect the materials and see if the bond is good.


## Strength

There's not really a "strong" adhesive in general, as there are many
kinds of strength, and what you need for your use case will
depend on a few things.

 - "Tensile strength": The amount of force needed to destroy the
   adhesive bond when a tensile force is applied. (Tensile force =
   pulling apart)

 - "Shear strength": The amount of force needed to destroy the
   adhesive bond when a shear force is applied. (Shear force = one
   piece goes down while another goes up)

 - "Compressive strength": The amount of force needed to destroy the
   adhesive bond when a compressive force is applied. (Compressive
   force = crushing)

 - "Bond strength": Not clear exactly what is meant, though it probably
   refers to either peel strength or tensile strength.

 - "Peel strength": This is how most adhesives are tested. The
   adhesive is applied to a substrate, cured, and then the amount
   of force to peel it off is measured.

Different things can change the "strength" of an adhesive, like the
temperature, the way it's applied, the surface prep, the material(s)
it's applied to.

Your adhesive's strength doesn't matter once you get to the strength
of the materials you're bonding. So look up the materials' strength
first, and then any adhesive which is at least that strong is good
enough (strength-wise). But of course consider what kind of forces
will be applied as well, in what environment, etc...

It's also important to consider flexibility. If one of your substrates
is very rigid and the other is very flexible, the bond will probably
break easily, because of the inability of the substrates to handle
transfers of force without building up too much tension. But if both
are rigid and your adhesive is flexible, the bond may break prematurely.


## General advice

 - Always check the surface prep instructions for that adhesive.
   Your bond will only be good if the substrate surface is clean.
   But some cleaning materials may damage your substrate.

 - Some adhesives benefit from a "primer" applied to the substrate
   in order to bond well. Some may benefit from an "activator".

 - Most adhesives benefit from a light 80-grit sanding of the
   substrate for better adhesion. (Don't go crazy, just rough it
   up a bit)

 - Some adhesives work better as a very thin film between substrates.
   Some work better when applied more thick.

 - Once the adhesive has developed a "skin", it's too late to
   adhere properly. Remove the adhesive and try again.

 - Some adhesives require you to wait until the adhesive becomes
   "tacky" on one substrate before you bond to the other substrate.

 - Most adhesives fully cure after 24 hours, and most require
   temperatures above 45F to cure properly. Some require up to
   a week (or more) to cure, and a very narrow temperature
   range.

 - Most adhesives can get damaged by being stored at temperatures
   below 40F. Most adhesives benefit from being warmed up
   so they flow easier. Some can be damaged or react weirdly
   if they're too hot (or exposed to direct sun before curing).

 - You can always email the manufacturer and ask them questions,
   they are happy to help.


## Comparison of adhesives

There are way too many kinds of adhesives in the world to list them
all here.

This is mostly a list of construction adhesives that are useful when
assembling a camper.
