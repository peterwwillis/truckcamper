# Materials / Research / Shell


## Metal

### Steel

- Flashing
  - Used to help keep water out of houses, this is thin metal sheets bent at a 90-degree angle. Could be really useful to reinforce corners in my build, or to protect door/window?

- Notes
  - Used in some camper shells as "corner caps" in stainless steel

### Aluminum

- Extruded aluminum / T-aluminum / 8020
  - Hard to source?
  - Each company has slightly different dimensions to inner slot

- ACM (Aluminum Composite Material)
  - Two thin sheets of aluminum sandwiching a plastic.
  - Easily bendable. Cannot support weight.

### Foam anchors

- Plastic spiral anchor - best hold overall (with gorilla glue original)
  - E-Z Anchor Lite
- Expanding anchor - weakest overall
- Metal spiral anchor - screws slip out

## Wood

- Lauan plywood
  - A hard, thin, light plywood, great for internal use, but environmentally unfriendly
  - Other plywoods have come on the market that are similar but more sustainable

- "Marine" grade plywood
  - Just a higher grade of plywood that has fewer voids and more water-resistant glue

- Cedar
  - A wood that is resistant to rot
  - There are many species of cedar, and some are wildly different than others, in terms of weight, strength, appearance, etc.


## Plastic

- [*https://www.mcmaster.com/products/fiberglass-(frp)-square-tubing/*](https://www.mcmaster.com/products/fiberglass-(frp)-square-tubing/)

## Fiberglass

- See Plastic above for FRP

- Tips
  - **Do not use polyester or vinyl ester resin on Styrofoam.** The styrene in the polyester or vinyl ester resin will melt it. Epoxy resin should be used.
  - One of the most important steps when working with fiberglass is surface preparation. Your surface must be clean and dry. The surface needs to be free of contaminates such as dust, existing paint, grease, oil etc. You can prepare your surface by sanding with a coarse sand paper and power sander. It can be time consuming but well worth it. Clean the surface with acetone to remove dust or grease.
  - Use metal screws and silicone sealant if fastening into fiberglass. ([*https://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f55/screwing-into-fiberglass-185876.html*](https://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f55/screwing-into-fiberglass-185876.html))

- Fiberglass
  - Some kinds (ex. Filon) are specially designed for RVs. I think they're more UV resistant? ([*https://www.recpro.com/rv-fiberglass-filon-siding-8-5-wide-arctic-white/*](https://www.recpro.com/rv-fiberglass-filon-siding-8-5-wide-arctic-white/))
  - Advertised as more durable than aluminum

- Composite Fiberglass
  - [*https://www.westsystem.com/instruction/epoxy-basics/applying-fiberglass-cloth-tape-2/estimating-epoxy-coverage-for-fabric-application/*](https://www.westsystem.com/instruction/epoxy-basics/applying-fiberglass-cloth-tape-2/estimating-epoxy-coverage-for-fabric-application/)

- [*Fiberglass cloth*](https://sales-947.myshopify.com/collections/fiberglass-cloth), also known as fiberglass fabric
  - low in weight and becomes strong when combined with resin. It works well for building composite parts, making molds and for fiberglass repairs. The lower weight fabrics are great for waterproofing. It becomes transparent when resin is added. The heavier fabrics are stronger and build up thickness quicker.
  - The 6, 7.5 and 10 ounce plain weave fabrics are the most commonly used. They have a simple plain weave pattern that is uniform in strength both horizontally and vertically. This pattern has warp and fill yarns that are interlaced over and under each other in alternating fashion. The plain weave is the easiest to handle since it does not unravel as much as the other weaves when cut.
  - Most fabrics are sold by the yard and come in 38", 50" and 60" widths. There is also the option of [*fiberglass tape*](https://sales-947.myshopify.com/collections/fiberglass-tape). The widths on these range from 1" to 12" and come in 50 yard rolls. Fiberglass tape has selvage edges to keep it from un-raveling and do not have an adhesive backing. They are used  with resin just like the regular fabrics.

- [*Chopped strand mat*](https://sales-947.myshopify.com/collections/chopped-strand-mat) is also known as fiberglass mat.
  - It is made up of short strands of fibers that are randomly oriented and held together with a resin binder. The resin binder needs styrene to dissolve properly. This makes it incompatible with epoxy resin. It is **only compatible with polyester and vinyl ester resin **which contains styrene. When polyester or vinyl ester resin is added to the mat, the binder dissolves and the fibers can be moved around. This makes it easy to conform to tight curves and corners.

  - Chopped strand mat is the most affordable fiberglass and is frequently used in mold construction or projects where thickness is needed. It is meant for non-structural application as it does not have much strength. If you need strength you should choose a woven cloth or you could mix the two. Mat can be used between layers of woven fabric to help build thickness quickly and to aid in all layers bonding well together.

  - Mat is also often used as the first layer, right before the [*gelcoat*](https://sales-947.myshopify.com/collections/gelcoats), in a laminate to hide print through from heavier fabrics. Print through is when the fabric weave texture shows through the resin. Mat is also easy to handle and can be torn instead of cut.

    - One gallon of mixed epoxy : 25 square yards cloth
  - 10 oz. fiberglass cloth

## Poor man's fiberglass (PMF)

-   Glue or paint applied to cloth on top of foam (or some other material). A crappy version of composite fiberglass (epoxy applied to a fiberglass on top of something else).

-   Glue tends to be Titebond II or III.

    -   Titebond III has the highest strength and best water proofing of the 3 wood glue grades of Titebond. PVA glues also don't require as long a clamping time as polyurethane glues and doesn't foam/expand. ([*http://titebond.com/App_Static/literature/glues/FF681_TBIIIUltimateBrochureTB.pdf*](http://titebond.com/App_Static/literature/glues/FF681_TBIIIUltimateBrochureTB.pdf))
        -   Weighs 9.22lbs/gallon
        -   Tensile strength 4000 psi
        -   Open time of 8-10 minutes

    -   ("waterproof wood glue (Titebond II) instead of epoxy for the layer between substrate and fabric, then any natural fiber fabric instead of fiberglass, then exterior acrylic paint on top")

    -   Some people use Gorilla Glue instead of Titebond
        -   ([*https://ncwoodworker.net/forums/index.php?threads/poor-mans-fibreglas.77679/*](https://ncwoodworker.net/forums/index.php?threads/poor-mans-fibreglas.77679/))
        -   Gorilla glue is ridiculous expensive (right now). Epoxy is as cheap/cheaper.

-   This has been used by lots of people to build teardrop campers, kayaks, etc, using just XPS foam and poor man's fiberglass. Apparently they hold up well over time.

    -   Sometimes they're using plywood on the inside, which could be a significant part of the strength.

    -   It does protect and strengthen plain XPS foam, based on unscientific tests on youtube. But there's no scientific tests to judge exactly how much.

-   The "science" behind it:

    -   XPS foam has weak tensile and shear strength.

    -   A cloth glued to the foam provides tensile/shear strength as the whole thing works as a composite.

    -   Basically if it can't stretch or bend the fabric, the foam won't bend or stretch either.

-   Application tips:

    -   Wash the canvas first before applying glue.

    -   Sand the XPS first, and maybe put some small holes in, before applying glue.

        -   "The rest of the body was pretty much the same system. Paint body with TBII, paint backside of canvas with TBII, unroll canvas, mist canvas with water, smooth out canvas, paint body with TBII, paint backside of canvas with TBII, unroll canvas, mist canvas with water, smooth out canvas, ect. I camped the canvas at the door opening so I did not have to worry about working around a clamp."

        -   "A water bottle and a small roller are real handy with the canvasing process. I used the water to keep the canvas damp and the roller to push the canvas into the TBII and smooth everything out."

        -   "In case anyone is wondering, I am using the Harbor Freight canvas drop cloth for the fabric. They sell a 12x9 Foot drop cloth and in my case was just barely enough to cover the entire body without a seam. I even had to cut the edge seems open so I could have enough to wrap around the top and ends. The area I was covering was 8\'2\", but I believe the canvas did shrink some. I had watered down the canvas down the night before to get some of the bad wrinkles out prior to gluing. I had to do a bit of pulling near the bottom to get the canvas to stretch enough to cover into the hatch area. I think that on the other side I am going to try to glue without pre-wetting the canvas.  The bad wrinkles that were still present seemed to smooth out fine with some extra water and working them with the roller. I had absolutely no shrinking of the canvas once applied on this side though."

        -   "I bought two canvas drop cloths and found this one to be nice and uniform. There is a seam near half way on the long length, but did not pose a problem for me for this build. I will be able to do the other side of the trailer without the seam getting in the way. Two 8\'2\" by 4\'2.5\" walls for the price of \$14.99 with some extra left over is not bad."

        -   "I did not try to fold or cut any canvas that was coated with full strength TBII. I diluted the TBII 3 to 1. I also misted the canvas with water where I knew I would be cutting before applying the TBII mixture. The canvas was still pretty stiff. After cutting I sprayed water on the canvas again before the final application of full strength TBII coating to the edge. This seemed to help soften up the canvas so that it could move around enough to lay flat. I just had to work it some with the roller, but eventually it smoothed out. It really was not too difficult."

        -   (later)

        -   "I have found with my second build that the corners are quite solid if you use liberal full strength TBII in the corner edging. By not adding flashing to the body before canvasing it saves time and effort by not having to fair in the flashing with spackle. If done right I think it will look just fine on the outside and can be used only in areas that many have a need for more protection."

        -   "Expansion rate of foam needs to be addressed. Foam tends to have a high expansion rate compared to other materials in the build. In most cases in this build it is just cosmetic. The biggest problem I have is the drivers side door. I made my measurements for door size in the morning and allowed 1/4\" clearance. I installed the door in the morning a few days later and all was good. Then I tried to open the door in the afternoon and the door was hitting the frame. Passenger side door is fine, but I remembered I made my measurements in the afternoon on that side when the foam had already heated up. This was my first indication of the expansion issue. I then noticed where I had to spliced the flashing on roof it was buckling and causing the canvas to buldge out when cold, it is fine when hot. Next was the front wall. Near the bottom, where the floor has another expansion rate, it tends to show the glue line between the side walls and the front wall. Since the side walls cant flex due to being glued to the floor the expansion and contraction of the front wall is noticeable along the front lower portion of the walls.  This problem will probably be noticeable on most builds.  To hide this on my second build I rapped the corners 2\".  This puts the corner cut line right on the foam to foam glue line and disguises any expansion issues."

        -   He seems to have used XPS for shelves with flashing to protect the edges ([*https://www.tnttt.com/viewtopic.php?f=55&t=60303*](https://www.tnttt.com/viewtopic.php?f=55&t=60303))

        -   "Ok a little test this weekend does show that indeed TBII bonds to Gripper. In fact, I think this combo may be a better bond than just using TBII to foam. It seems the gripper bonds better to the foam than TBII and TBII bonds real well to Gripper\...." / "So I had a piece of foam that was coated with Gripper on one side and was bare foam on the other. I took some painters paper and glued it to both sides of the foam. Once dried I tried to peal the paper off of the foam that just had TBII applied. I was able to easily get my fingernail under the paper and pull it away from the foam." / "Now for the side with Gripper.  I had a hard time getting ahold of the paper with my fingernail. Once I did get ahold of it, it was hard to try and get the paper to peel up and would tear. As you can see the TBII and Gripper bond never failed. You can see where I had to gouge into the foam to try and get the paper to lift up." / "Finally I was able to get a good grip on the paper and was able to carefully pull the paper back. It was harder to pull back than with just the TBII and paper. So this makes be a believer that the Gripper is a viable medium to apply before the application of TBII for a good bond to dissimilar materials."

        -   "My choice for skinning is TBII 50/50. I have applied canvas with this mix over bare foam, painted foam, primed foam.  It sticks! After that I paint over it with another coat of TBII 50/50 to fill the canvas weave totally. Then I give it a sanding to knock of the high points then a coat of primer and then 2 coats of latex paint. It works! The beauty of this is that if you do have a failure, delamination or bubbles (I have fixed both), it is a easy fix. TBII 50/50 and a small needle syringe and you fixed up and ready to go in no time. It works."

        -   " I don\'t, however, use paint/primer to attach canvas.  Tight Bond II, usually diluted 50/50 is what I use. I first sand the foam with a light grit paper and then wipe down the foam with alcohol. I then apply the bonding primer before laying the canvas. I have found that the primer bonds better to the foam and the TBII bonds great to the primer."

        -   "You only put glue between the canvas and the surface, not over the canvas again. You use exterior grade paint on the outside of the canvas. I did mine onto foam with Titebond 2 glue. Once that was dry we applied a 50/50 mix of exterior paint and water for the first coat. Second coat was 75/25 paint/water and the third coat was 100% exterior paint. I followed advice from TnTT.com forum and The L Wood by Lucy on YouTube for how to apply it(link below).  One thing to watch out for is many people use cotton canvas drop clothes but those should be washed first to remove some of the excess fuzz. I bought an 8' wide roll of cotton duck cloth for mine and had no issues applying it straight off the roll. I even had to trim back some of the canvas on my windows opening and had a hard time getting it to separate from the wood."

        -   "The best place I found for canvas in big enough rolls to cover one side without seams is: https://www.bigduckcanvas.com/"

    -   [*https://www.tnttt.com/viewtopic.php?t=64361*](https://www.tnttt.com/viewtopic.php?t=64361)

-   Repair tips:

    -   Supposedly if you dent the foam or it delaminates, you can put a cloth down over the PMF and heat it with an iron, and the glue will become liquid again, and the foam may return to its original shape.

-   Typical problems:

    -   bubbles forming under the fabric due to moisture or offgassing

-   Other fabrics:

    -   fiberglass screen, metal screen, landscaping fabric, roof repair fabric

    -   Only seen one person on YouTube use metal screen. He mentioned also using fiberglass, which yeah fiberglass is gonna make it really strong, but I guess the paint is a decent enough bond compared to epoxy which is more expensive.

    -   In theory this could be stronger than fabric, but that probably depends on the fabric, testing needed. The metal screen will probably resist impacts better than cloth.

    -   Not sure if cheaper than fabric.

    -   More paint is needed for PMF than PMMF. probably has some effect on the result, not sure.

## Adhesives

### Tapes

-   VHB tape

    -   Suitable for metals, other surfaces

    -   "The \[1/16th aluminum\] panels are secured to the camper with a VHB (Very High Bond) acrylic mounting tape made by 3M that is designed for mounting panels to a frame. The VHB is such a strong fastener, that it is actually reinforcing the welds while dampening vibrations and impact that the camper takes when driving off road. On top of this, it seals out all water and requires zero holes unlike rivets. It is able to last 30+ years. Watch this video if you're not convinced: VHB Strength Demonstration . The camper is then double sealed with some of the best marine grade sealants that are UV stable." ([*https://www.radicaproducts.com/moonlander*](https://www.radicaproducts.com/moonlander))

### Resins

-   Resin has a short shelf life. Try to store the resin in a cool dry place, or refrigerate (do not freeze) it to extend the life of the resin.

-   [*Polyester*](https://sales-947.myshopify.com/collections/polyester-resin) resin

    -    It is the easiest to use when compared to vinyl ester and epoxy resin. It is also the most economical. Polyester resin has a quick cure and adds dimensional stability. It has many different uses and is often used in building/repairing boats, car bodies, patio decks, surfboards, kayaks, decorative surfaces, outdoor ponds, bath tubs, plus more. **If you will be finishing with a gel coat, it is important to use either polyester or vinyl ester resin as your laminating resin. Gel coats are polyester resins and will not adhere well if epoxy resin is used first.**

    -   There are several grades of polyester resins including ISO (isophthalic) and Ortho (orthophthalic). The most popular is the [***Ortho***](https://fiberglasswarehouse.com/collections/polyester-resin/products/ortho-general-purpose-polyester-resin)[* General Purpose Laminating Resin*](https://fiberglasswarehouse.com/collections/polyester-resin/products/ortho-general-purpose-polyester-resin), but ISO is better. Surfboard resin is also better.

-   [*Vinyl ester resin*](https://sales-947.myshopify.com/collections/vinylester-resin)

    -   falls between the polyester and epoxy resin when it comes to different characteristics and cost. It has a longer molecular chain than polyester resin which helps it absorb impact better than polyester and it shrinks less. There is also less chance of de-lamination when using VE resin. Vinyl ester can be used as a final coat after polyester resin to create a better water barrier.

    -   Vinyl Ester resin is also more resistant to solvents and water degradation. It is typically used in boat hulls, gas tanks, kayaks, canoes and other items that will be exposed to chemicals such as fuel or water for extended periods of time.

-   -MEKP- Catalyst for Vinyl Ester Resin and Polyester Resins

    -   [*MEKP*](https://sales-947.myshopify.com/collections/vinylester-resin/products/mekp-catalyst) (methyl ethyl ketone peroxide) is the necessary catalyst for polyester and vinyl ester resins and gel coats. Without MEKP there will not be the needed chemical reaction that turns the liquid resin into a solid. It is designed for a room temperature cure.

    -   More or less catalyst can be added depending on how long of a pot life and working time is desired. Pot life is the amount of time it takes before the resin hardens in a mixing cup.  Unlike epoxy resin, polyester and vinyl ester cure time can be manipulated by the amounts of MEKP added. Typically, catalyst is used between 1.25% to 1.75% (1 2/3 ounce to 2 1/3 ounces per gallon).

    -   The ideal temperature to work in is 70 degrees. It is not recommended to work in temps under 60 degrees Farenheit and the product could cure too fast if the temperature is above 80 degrees Farenheit.

-   [*Epoxy resin*](https://sales-947.myshopify.com/collections/epoxy-resin)

    -   Two basic kinds of epoxy:

        -   One-component: requires you to provide heat to cure the epoxy.

        -   Two-component: An advanced system that comes in two parts.  The resin side is typically designated as the 'A' side.  The 'B' side is the hardener side. It comes in a variety of mix ratios including 2:1 or 4:1 ratios by weight or volume. For example, a gallon of Part A would require a half gallon of Part B with a 2:1 by weight system. Must be mixed thoroughly and slowly until all striations from the two liquids are invisible/gone, and air bubbles removed before pouring. All corners of the mixing vessel must be scraped to properly mix epoxy. To avoid pouring in unmixed epoxy, you can transfer mixed epoxy from one vessel to another and pour from the second vessel.

    -   Different formulations of epoxy resin exist:

        -   Deep pour: intended to be poured thicker, 1" to 2" thick

        -   Table top: intended to be poured thinner, ⅛" to ¼" thick.  Typically gels faster than "Art", and may have higher hardness and heat deflection. Good for clear coating.

        -   "Art": typically has UV inhibitors added and a longer gel time. Good for clear coating.

        -   "Non-blushing": Doesn't form a waxy coating (amine blush) on cured surfaces, so it saves time for laminating/bonding/etc.

        -   "LV": Low Viscosity resin is thinner than "FLAG" epoxy and can soak into wood better. Better for laminating.

        -   "FLAG": Filling, Laminating and Gluing. A medium viscosity resin. Better for gluing and bonding, filling, and clear coating. Combine with Colloidal Silica to create an excellent thickened high strength adhesive.

        -   "Traditional Marine": a 5:1 system, can be cheaper than 2:1 systems above. A "Fast" and "Slow" hardener are more structural, and the "Clear" hardener is more of a top coat.

            -   For a 5:1 system, based on MAS Epoxy's calculator:

                -   A 96"x96"x0.25" surface area of epoxy is 2304 cubic inches, requiring 1276.45 ounces of mixed epoxy (10 gallons!).

                -   By VOLUME that's 1063.7083 oz Epoxy Resin with 212.7416 oz 520 Slow Hardener.

    -   Some epoxies may come with a filler, for example to replace rotted wood.

    -   Stronger than polyester and vinyl ester resin and is ideal for high performance and light weight parts.

    -   It is water resistant and has good flexibility.

    -   It has great bonding capability and a fast wet out.

    -   Epoxies have a low odor compared to other resins.

    -   One of the only downsides to epoxy is that it is more expensive than polyester and vinyl ester resin.

    -   It can be used with carbon fiber, Kevlar and fiberglass cloth **(NOT compatible with chopped strand mat)**.

    -   There is a choice of three different hardeners for epoxy resin: fast, medium and slow. Which speed of hardener chosen depends on the working temperature, the desired working time and the needed drying time.

    -   Epoxies dry with a full surface cure.

    -   It is ideal to work in temperatures around 75-80 degrees. It is also important to warm up the resin and the working surface to room temperature if it is too cold. **Mixing cold resin will create many air bubbles.** The room and surface should stay warm through the whole curing process (approx. 3 days).

    -   Measuring the correct ratio of A:B is EXTREMELY important. Most problems that occur with improper cure is due to not measuring the correct ratio or not mixing thoroughly. When mixing, the sides and bottom of the mixing cup should be scraped down well.

    -   **It is very important that you do not add extra hardener to try and speed up the cure time.** This will ruin your project.  Instead, heat up the room to accelerate the process.

    -   **Supposedly, you cannot use a gel coat on epoxy resin. However, **[*this link*](https://www.epoxyworks.com/index.php/applying-polyester-gelcoat-over-epoxy/) explains that there is a finishing process you can use to prevent problems.

-   Safety

    -   It is important to wear proper safety clothing to protect you from fumes and from getting hazardous material on your skin.  Always wear a good respirator mask to protect from the fumes during the laminating process. You should also wear a respirator mask when cutting fiberglass, spraying gel coat or resin, working with solvents or sanding the finished laminate.

    -   Wear gloves when working with fiberglass and resin.  [](https://sales-947.myshopify.com/collections/safety/products/nitrile-glove-box-100-count)[*Nitrile gloves*](https://sales-947.myshopify.com/collections/safety/products/nitrile-glove-box-100-count) work best with epoxies. Also, eye protection is a must.  Getting resin or catalyst in your eyes can cause permanent damage. Just the fumes alone could irritate your eyes making it very uncomfortable to work. Make sure the protective eye wear you choose is shatter proof.

### For Foams

-   Foam Fusion

    -   Adheres very well. Is clear, cleans up easily. Seems to be the best (or one of the best) for foam-to-foam.

    -   Some videos show it not setting up, being wet after 24hrs (when used for screw holes)

-   Foam Fast

    -   Seems to have good strength but need more info

-   PL 300

    -   Suitable for foam to foam, foam to wood. Not sure about other mediums.

-   Gorilla Glue Original

    -   Can adhere well, but not fantastic. Bubbles up when setting, requires clamping. Wet the surface first. Expands and becomes messy around joints. Not suitable for filling gaps, even if it does foam into them.

-   Wood Glue (PVA)

    -   Will not bond very well. The foam is waterproof/water resistant and wood glue needs something (like wood) to remove the water from the glue for it to set up.

    -   If the foam is sanded roughly and then cleaned with alcohol, wood glue will bond to it.

-   Great Stuff

    -   Messy, expands, needs clamping, but may provide a good bond.  Needs more research

-   E6000

    -   NOT suitable for XPS foam.

-   Notes

    -   "Some suggestions regarding glue application: Polyurethane is activated with moisture (Humidity). The other adhesives need the volatile solvents evaporated, so it helps to use a mastic spreader with fine notches to avoid excessive drying time. All of them should have pressure applied during the cure."
