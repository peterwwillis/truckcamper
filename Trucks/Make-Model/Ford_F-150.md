# Trucks / Ford F-150

The F-150 is a light-duty, full-size, half-ton pickup truck.

It is larger than the Ford Ranger, both in dimensions, and in towing and payload capacity.

It is smaller than the Super Duty line of trucks, again in dimensions and towing/payload capacity.


## Gas mileage

As there are many configurations of this truck, the gas mileage will vary based on a number of factors.

Possible gas mileage over the years varies from 12 mpg to 30+ mpg, depending on the engine, fuel type, drivetrain, tires, etc.


## Camper configuration

When configured with the Heavy-Duty Payload Package, the 2020 Ford F-150 (14th gen) has a potential maximum payload rating of 3,270 lbs. This is sufficient to carry most small to medium-size campers, although larger campers can easily exceed this weight rating.

However, very few of these models can be found, and the typical F-150's payload rating is 1000 lbs lower than this.

Therefore the F-150 should typically be chosen for pop-up campers, and light hard-side campers.

### Truck modifications


- [*Hellwig Helper Springs*](https://www.hellwigproducts.com/product-list/helper-springs/)

- [*Suspension mods*](https://www.truckcamperadventure.com/the-top-6-suspension-upgrades-for-truck-camper-rigs/)


## Model years

There are currently 15 generations of Ford F-150.




To haul a truck camper, you will want:

-   Ford's heavy-duty payload package

-   Maybe an improved braking package??


Must-haves:

-   Cruise control

-   4WD

-   Payload capacity at least 2,000lbs

-   Over 20mpg combined

-   Minimum 6.5ft bed (141" wheelbase)

Should-haves:

-   Spring reinforcements

-   Air suspension

-   Gas (diesel not great in winter)

-   Extended range fuel tank

-   8ft bed

-   Heavy-duty payload package

-   Tow package

-   Adaptive cruise control

-   NOT USED IN SALT

---



## Conclusions

-   Between the 2.7L and 3.5L EcoBoosts, the 3.5L gives you more payload, towing, torque and horsepower, for almost the same cost, for 1-2mpg less fuel economy. **Take the 3.5L EcoBoost.**

-   Has some aerodynamic benefits:

-   Tow Packages

    -   Reason to get a tow package:

        -   Front stabilizer bar upgrade (might be expensive to install)

        -   Class IV hitch (can DIY it)

    -   Towing Package is 53 (B)

    -   Max Towing Package is 53 (C)

    -   Links

    -   Max Tow is:

        -   3.5 EB engine

        -   3.55 elocker rear dif

        -   36 gallon fuel tank

        -   Aux transmission and engine oil coolers

        -   Upgraded hitch (bumper)

        -   Brake Controller

        -   Front Stabilizer Bar

    -   Axles:

        -   53C gets a 3.55 minimum

        -   53A gets a 3.31 minimum

        -   So 3.31 could be an A or B but not a C

        -   Less than 3.31 can't be an A
