# Trucks

## How to choose a truck

1. Figure out your budget first, for the camper, and then the truck. This will change
   what you end up picking if it turns out you can't afford something really big or
   expensive. Consider insurance, fuel, repairs, maintenance (tires, oil, misc),
   cost of the camper, cost of the truck.

2. Your truck has to be able to handle your camper safely. It will be easier to pick
   a camper you like first, and then pick a truck that fits the camper.

3. Have the camper you want weighed, because the advertised numbers lie. When you know
   the real wet weight, add the weight of passengers and gear, and that's the minimum
   payload rating your truck needs. Refer to the **Payload** section below.

4. Choose a truck you enjoy driving, especially if you will be going long distances.
   You won't want to go on long road trips if it's painful to ride in. Longer trucks
   can be harder to maneuver and park, but they are more stable on highways.

5. When in doubt, get a bigger truck. Many heavy-duty trucks can be less expensive
   than less-capable smaller trucks, due to options and availability. Though if
   overlanding is your goal, a small, short-wheelbase, light truck with a very
   minimal pop-up camper is ideal.

6. Before final decision, Google the year/make/model of the truck and look for
   common problems. Check the Carfax for the vehicle if preowned. Check the specific
   truck's options, payload (found only in a sticker on the inside door panel).
   Check that its wheels and tires' load ratings meet your payload requirements.
   If you can, look up the dealer window sticker attached to the vehicle when it
   was first sold (sometimes available from Carfax); this will confirm the options
   attached to the vehicle at sale time (useful for things that affect payload,
   like axle, differential, towing & payload packages, engine, etc).

7. Have an independent mechanic inspect the truck before sale. If they find any
   issues, either walk away, or use it to negotiate down the price.
