# Trucks

Here are some notes on trucks for truck campers.

## How to choose a truck

<details>

1. Figure out your budget first, for the camper, and then the truck. This will change
   what you end up picking if it turns out you can't afford something really big or
   expensive. Consider insurance, fuel, repairs, maintenance (tires, oil, misc),
   cost of the camper, cost of the truck.

2. Your truck has to be able to handle your camper safely. It will be easier to pick
   a camper you like first, and then pick a truck that fits the camper.

3. Have the camper you want weighed, because the advertised numbers lie. When you know
   the real wet weight, add the weight of passengers and gear, and that's the minimum
   payload rating your truck needs. Refer to the **Payload** section below.

4. Choose a truck you enjoy driving, especially if you will be going long distances.
   You won't want to go on long road trips if it's painful to ride in. Longer trucks
   can be harder to maneuver and park, but they are more stable on highways.

5. When in doubt, get a bigger truck. Many heavy-duty trucks can be less expensive
   than less-capable smaller trucks, due to options and availability. Though if
   overlanding is your goal, a small, short-wheelbase, light truck with a very
   minimal pop-up camper is ideal.

6. Before final decision, Google the year/make/model of the truck and look for
   common problems. Check the Carfax for the vehicle if preowned. Check the specific
   truck's options, payload (found only in a sticker on the inside door panel).
   Check that its wheels and tires' load ratings meet your payload requirements.
   If you can, look up the dealer window sticker attached to the vehicle when it
   was first sold (sometimes available from Carfax); this will confirm the options
   attached to the vehicle at sale time (useful for things that affect payload,
   like axle, differential, towing & payload packages, engine, etc).

7. Have an independent mechanic inspect the truck before sale. If they find any
   issues, either walk away, or use it to negotiate down the price.

## Truck Makes & Models

<details>

### Light-duty Mid-size (Class 1)

These trucks have low payload capacity, so you will end up being limited in the camper
you can carry. You may also not see very good fuel economy when loaded. However, these
are ideal for overlanding due to being more nimble on trails. These also tend to have
the best fuel economy if you will have the camper off most of the time.

### Light-duty Full-size (Class 2a-2b)

These trucks still don't have great payload capacity. There is still a wide selection of
campers, but mostly the smaller, lighter ones with less amenities.

#### Half-ton

 - The Ford F-150 has the highest payload capacity in its class, but it requires the Heavy
   Duty Payload Package which few of the trucks come with, and with earlier model years it's
   not possible to add this later as it includes larger frame rails.

Selection of half-ton trucks for campers:
- [https://www.truckcamperadventure.com/best-half-ton-trucks-for-maximum-truck-camper-payload/](https://www.truckcamperadventure.com/best-half-ton-trucks-for-maximum-truck-camper-payload/)

### Medium-duty (Class 3-6)

These trucks can handle larger payloads and tow ratings, and most campers can be hauled by
some form of Medium-duty truck.

You still need to check the payload rating of the individual truck, even if it "looks"
like it can handle anything you throw at it. For example, an F-350 with dual rear wheels
may still have a payload rating below some larger campers' wet weight.


</details> <!-- Truck Makes & Models -->



## Payload capacity

<details>

The payload capacity is how much you can safely carry in/on the truck, including passengers
and gear. Everything you add to the truck, brings down the payload number.

The truck's payload rating determines what camper you can safely carry. **You cannot
increase payload capacity.** Your truck must have a payload rating sufficient for the
camper you want.

Every truck that rolls off the assembly line can have *a different payload* than the last truck. Trucks are ordered with options, and those options change what the truck can safely carry.

A truck brochure may claim *"3,500lbs maximum payload!!!"*, but it may turn out only a few trucks can actually reach that. The individual truck you buy may only have a 1,500lbs payload due to its configuration. Even heavy-duty trucks can have surprisingly small payload ratings due to their configuration.

Therefore: always check the payload of the individual truck. You can do this two ways:

- (Option 1) Open the driver-side door and look at the inside of the door jamb. There should be a sticker that specifically says the payload rating. There are multiple stickers here, so look carefully.

- (Option 2) Bring your truck to a set of truck scales and weigh the truck when empty. Then look up the **gross vehicle weight rating** (**GVWR**) of your particular truck (again, check the driver-side door jamb sticker). Subtract the curb weight from the GVWR, subtract the combined weight of all passengers, and that's your payload rating.

### Weighing the truck

In order to accurately assess where you stand when it comes to payload, you should take your fully loaded truck and camper [to a local](https://www.truckcamperadventure.com/taking-the-cat-scale-truck-camper-challenge/) [*Certified Automated Truck (CAT) Scale*](https://www.truckcamperadventure.com/taking-the-cat-scale-truck-camper-challenge/).

Three figures are provided each time you have your truck and camper weighed: the two axle weights plus the total weight of the rig.

Owners should take their truck to the scale first without the camper, then have their truck and camper weighed together later to determine the actual weight of each (the truck and the camper).

Be mindful that, every time you weigh, you should duplicate important fluid levels like fresh water and diesel/gas when obtaining these numbers.

Campers can be heavier than the weight advertised by the camper company. However, many people who report heavier campers simply haven't determined the correct weight for their individual camper. The camper must be empty of any water or gear. In addition, campers are often modified at the factory with additional options, which increase their weight (similar to trucks), so the true weight should be inquired at time of purchase from a dealer.


### Achieving a payload capacity

If you modify your truck, for example by getting bigger tires, adding more leaf springs, etc, that may change the weight of the truck, which will change your payload capacity.

Reducing weight can increase payload capacity, so choosing lighter-weight parts, or removing unnecessary add-ons, can help increase payload.


#### Wheels & Tires

You can potentially increase payload, up to the capacity of the axle(s), by increasing the wheel and tire load capacity.

If you research the actual GAWRs with the axle manufacturer you'll probably be surprised to learn that you have several hundreds, if not thousands, of additional pounds of cargo carrying capacity (for example: the AAM 11.5 rear axle found on Ram 3500 trucks has a 10,000-pound GAWR rating, 3,000 pounds more than the GAWR given by FCA).

You can tap into this additional cargo carrying capacity by buying better wheels and tires with higher load ratings.

- Light Truck (LT) tires with a load range C, D, or E, typically have a higher weight rating that can help you achieve your maximum payload rating.
- Some aftermarket 10-ply, load range E tires offer a 4,080-pound weight capacity, while others offer an acceptable 3,640-pound capacity.
- Check your wheels' weight ratings. Even if you buy a truck with a Heavy-Duty Payload Package, someone might have changed the wheels out for ones with a lower weight rating.

## Fuel economy

<details>

Most trucks will not get very good fuel economy with a truck camper.

However, if you can get slightly better fuel economy, the savings can add up over time.

| 20,000           | 68 MPGe         | $0.38/kWh | **$3,767**          | **$56,505**               | The electric price is up to $0.38/kWh in Hawaii, and some public chargers can charge up to $0.50/kWh, which can make  some road trips add up fast. |

## Engine Types

<details>

**On electric trucks:** I haven't included much eletric truck research here yet, but consider:

 - They tend to not have great payload or tow ratings (so far)
 - They can lose range with more load, so you won't go as far. They also lose up to
   1/3 of their range in cold weather.
 - Many camp sites don't allow charging at the camp-site hookup. They also only
   offer 120VAC, so you will get about 1 mile per 1.5 hrs charging, if they allow it.

**On hybrid trucks:** Comparable to regular gas trucks, but with decreased payload and
marginally better fuel economy, but more power.

**On LPG trucks:** Not done any research on this.


### Engine impact on Payload

For a specific truck model, the engine choice will usually change the payload capacity.

Heavier engines, OR engines without as much power, can reduce payload capacity.

Different engines also change the axle, transmission, and differential, which all
affect payload capacity.


### Horsepower & Torque

In general, diesels win, but there are exceptions.

- Gas engines lose power by 3-4% per 1,000 ft. elevation. To maintain performance, reduce GVWs and GCWs by 2% per 1,000 ft. elevation starting at the 1,000 ft. elevation point.

- Check the entire torque band rating for a motor. Gas engines' torque can be very low at low RPMs. You may want more low-end torque to haul a camper (for example, if you're parked on a hill, or going up a hill at high elevation).

- Turbos add power at elevation by increasing air density, so a turbo gas or diesel will do much better than a naturally-aspirated equivalent.

| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fuel economy**       | Diesel engines have better fuel economy than gasoline because diesel is more energy-dense (so there's more energy per volume), and diesel engines have higher compression ratios which makes for more efficient extraction of energy. Since they are more fuel efficient, you will therefore travel farther on a tank of diesel than gas. | Gas engines have worse fuel economy than diesels in general, though some newer, smaller engines are much more fuel efficient than in the past. |
| **Fuel prices**        | Diesel fuel prices tend to be more expensive than gasoline, sometimes significantly more expensive. Plus you occasionally need to add diesel exhaust fluid. So you may not save as much money over time as you think.                                                                                                                     | Gasoline fuel prices tend to be lower, depending on the part of the country you're in.                                                         |
| **Longevity**          | Diesel engines tend to last longer than gasoline engines. There's nothing in particular about their design that causes this; they just tend to be built to withstand more abuse, as they are expected to be used for more demanding tasks. A higher-mileage diesel engine generally isn't a concern as it is with gas engines.            | Gas engines don't tend to last as long as diesels, but they can last a long time with proper maintenance.                                      |
| **Power**              | Diesel engines tend to have much more lower-end torque than gasoline engines. This is good for hauling heavy payloads and towing.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Gas engines tend to have much worse low-end torque which can make it challenging to haul heavy loads under certain conditions.                 |
| **Cost**               | Diesel trucks are typically more expensive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Gas trucks are typically less expensive then diesels.                                                                                          |
| **Truck Availability** | Diesel engines are increasingly hard to find in medium- to full-size trucks. However, they are more popular outside the USA.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Gas engines are widely available.                                                                                                              |
| **Fuel Availability**  | In the USA can be harder to find diesel if you are stranded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | In the USA it can be easier to find gasoline than diesel.                                                                                      |
| **Elevation**          | Diesel engines are more efficient at high elevation than naturally-aspirated gasoline engines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Gas engines lose power at high elevation, but a turbocharger can help counteract this.                                                         |
| **Payload**            | Diesel engines tend to be heavier, reducing payload capacity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Gas engines can be lighter, creating more payload capacity. (The highest payload capacity Ford F-150 is a gasoline 3.5L V6 Turbo)              |


### General recommendations

- If cost is no concern, OR you don't want a small truck, OR you need to haul something heavy, AND you want it to work fine at high elevation, get a diesel. More power & low-end torque, lasts longer, better fuel economy, is fine at elevation, and fine in the cold (as long as you maintain the glow plugs and try to use winter fuel when possible).
- If you can't find a diesel, or it doesn't fit your budget or use-case, a turbo gasoline engine is a good all-around option. It won't have good low-end torque but it will probably do well enough.
- If you want a small-ish fuel-efficient truck, go with gas, hybrid or electric.
- If you're going to tour the world with it, you may find diesel fuel (& mechanics/parts) are more widely available.
