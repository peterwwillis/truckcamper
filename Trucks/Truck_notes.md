# Trucks

Here are some notes on trucks for truck campers.

## Payload capacity

You will want to pair a truck camper with a truck that is capable of carrying that camper safely. Therefore, the first thing to look for is the payload rating of the truck.

Every truck that rolls off the assembly line can have a different payload than the last truck. This is because trucks are ordered with options, and those options change the overall weight of the truck and its payload capacity.

A truck brochure may claim a maximum payload that seems high, but the specific truck you order may end up with a much lower payload rating. Even heavy-duty trucks can have surprisingly small payload ratings due to their configuration.

Therefore you must always check the payload of the individual truck. You can do this two ways:

1. Open the driver-side door and look at the inside of the door jamb. There should be a sticker that specifically says the payload rating. There are multiple stickers here, so look carefully.

2. Bring your truck to a set of truck scales and weigh the truck when empty. Then look up the **gross vehicle weight rating** (**GVWR**) of your particular truck (again, check the driver-side door jamb sticker). Subtract the curb weight from the GVWR, subtract the combined weight of all passengers, and that's your payload rating.

### Weighing the truck

In order to accurately assess where you stand when it comes to payload, you should take your fully loaded truck and camper [to a local](https://www.truckcamperadventure.com/taking-the-cat-scale-truck-camper-challenge/) [*Certified Automated Truck (CAT) Scale*](https://www.truckcamperadventure.com/taking-the-cat-scale-truck-camper-challenge/).

Three figures are provided each time you have your truck and camper weighed: the two axle weights plus the total weight of the rig.

Owners should take their truck to the scale first without the camper, then have their truck and camper weighed together later to determine the actual weight of each (the truck and the camper).

Be mindful that, every time you weigh, you should duplicate important fluid levels like fresh water and diesel/gas when obtaining these numbers.

Campers can be heavier than the weight advertised by the camper company. However, many people who report heavier campers simply haven't determined the correct weight for their individual camper. The camper must be empty of any water or gear. In addition, campers are often modified at the factory with additional options, which increase their weight (similar to trucks), so the true weight should be inquired at time of purchase from a dealer.


### Achieving a payload capacity

If you modify your truck, for example by getting bigger tires, adding more leaf springs, etc, that may change the weight of the truck, which will change your payload capacity.

Reducing weight can increase payload capacity, so choosing lighter-weight parts, or removing unnecessary add-ons, can help increase payload.

You can also potentially increase payload, up to the capacity of the axle(s), by increasing the wheel and tire load capacity.

- If you research the actual GAWRs with the axle manufacturer you'll probably be surprised to learn that you have several hundreds, if not thousands, of additional pounds of cargo carrying capacity (this is especially true with the AAM 11.5 rear axle found on Ram 3500 trucks, which has a 10,000-pound GAWR rating, 3,000 pounds more than the GAWR given by FCA). You can tap into this additional cargo carrying capacity by simply buying better wheels and tires with higher load ratings. For example, some aftermarket 10-ply, load range E tires offer a 4,080-pound weight capacity, while others offer an acceptable 3,640-pound capacity.



#### Tires

Even if your truck has a huge payload rating, if you put on tires that can't handle the weight, then you haven't actually achieved the payload rating.

Light Truck (LT) tires with a load range C, D, or E, typically have a higher weight rating that can help you achieve your maximum payload rating.

## Fuel economy

Most trucks will not get very good fuel economy with a truck camper.

However, if you can get slightly better fuel economy, the savings can add up over time.

## Engine Types

Thus far, my research has showed that it can be difficult to truck- camp with an electric truck.

 - The trucks themselves lose efficiency with more load, so you won't be going as far.
 - Many (most?) camp sites don't allow charging at the camp-site hookup. They also only
   offer 120VAC, so you will get about 1 mile per 1.5 hrs charging, if they allow it.
   be a burden.
 - Elevation isn't a burden, but cold weather is, with 1/3 reduction in range due from
   extreme cold.

Therefore for now I'm only considering gas, diesel and hybrids. If somebody uses their
electric truck as a truck camper and enjoys it, let me know and I can provide more detail
here.

So, do you want a gasoline engine or diesel engine?


### Horsepower & Torque

In general, diesels win, but there are exceptions.

- Gas engines lose power by 3-4% per 1,000 ft. elevation. To maintain performance, reduce GVWs and GCWs by 2% per 1,000 ft. elevation starting at the 1,000 ft. elevation point.

- Check the entire torque band rating for a motor. Gas engines' torque can be very low at low RPMs. You may want more low-end torque to haul a camper (for example, if you're parked on a hill, or going up a hill at high elevation).

- Turbos add power at elevation by increasing air density, so a turbo gas or diesel will do much better than a naturally-aspirated equivalent.

### Diesel

#### Pros

- Diesel engines have better fuel economy than gasoline because diesel is more energy-dense (so there's more energy per volume), and diesel engines have higher compression ratios which makes for more efficient extraction of energy.
  
Since they are more fuel efficient, you will therefore travel farther on a tank of diesel than gas.

- Diesel engines tend to last longer than gasoline engines. There's nothing in particular about their design that causes this; they just tend to be built to withstand more abuse, as they are expected to be used for more demanding tasks.

- Diesel engines tend to have much more lower-end torque than gasoline engines. This is very good for hauling heavy payloads and towing.

- Diesel engines are more efficient at high elevation than naturally-aspirated gasoline engines.

- Diesel fuel may be easier to find in some countries than gasoline.

#### Cons

- Diesel fuel prices tend to be more expensive than gasoline, sometimes significantly more expensive. So you may not save much money over time.

- [Diesel exhaust fluid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_exhaust_fluid) is an extra expense.

- Diesel trucks are typically more expensive, and are hard to impossible to find for medium- and full-size trucks.

- Diesel engines tend to be heavier, reducing payload capacity.
