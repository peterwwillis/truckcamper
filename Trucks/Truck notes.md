To haul a truck camper, you will need:

-   Ford's heavy-duty payload package

-   OR

    -   light truck (LT) load range C, D or E wheels and tires

Must-haves:

-   Cruise control

-   4WD

-   Payload capacity at least 2,000lbs

-   Over 20mpg combined

-   Minimum 6.5ft bed (141" wheelbase)

Should-haves:

-   Spring reinforcements

-   Air suspension

-   Gas (diesel not great in winter)

-   Extended range fuel tank

-   8ft bed

-   Heavy-duty payload package

-   Tow package

-   Adaptive cruise control

-   NOT USED IN SALT

[]{#anchor}Payload

-   You can increase payload capacity by reducing weight

-   You can increase payload capacity by increasing wheel and tire load
    > capacity, up to the capacity of the axle

    -   If you research the actual GAWRs with the axle manufacturer
        > you'll probably be surprised to learn that you have several
        > hundreds, if not thousands, of additional pounds of cargo
        > carrying capacity (this is especially true with the AAM 11.5
        > rear axle found on Ram 3500 trucks, which has a 10,000-pound
        > GAWR rating, 3,000 pounds more than the GAWR given by FCA).
        > You can tap into this additional cargo carrying capacity by
        > simply buying better wheels and tires with higher load
        > ratings. For example, some aftermarket 10 ply, load range E
        > tires offer a 4,080-pound weight capacity, while others offer
        > an acceptable 3,640-pound capacity.

[]{#anchor-1}Gas Mileage

Cost of gas

-   20,000 miles \* 20mpg @ \$4/gal = \$**4000**

    -   \$4000 \* 15 years = \$60,000

-   20,000 miles \* 12mpg @ \$4/gal = \$**6667**

    -   \$6667 \* 15 years = \$100,000

[]{#anchor-2}Horsepower & Torque

Remember to check the entire torque band rating for the motor.

It may be really low torque at low RPMs for gas engines.

Gasoline engines lose power by 3-4% per 1,000 ft. elevation.\
To maintain performance, reduce GVWs and GCWs by 2% per 1,000 ft.
elevation starting at the 1,000 ft. elevation point.

-   Gas engines' torque can be extremely low at low RPMS

[]{#anchor-36}Selected Truck

[]{#anchor-37}2020 Ford F-150 XLT

Rationale:

-   Regular Cab 8-foot bed

    -   Max amount of camper on the truck

    -   Not the longest wheelbase, not the shortest. Short wheelbase is
        > good for rock crawling but not stability when hauling; longer
        > wheelbase adds weight which can reduce payload.

    -   Maximizes how much camper is towards the middle of the truck,
        > which keeps the truck more balanced with the camper on it.

    -   Reduces weight to get the payload number up

-   Decent payload number (2147)

    -   All other half-ton trucks top out at around 2000 lbs payload,
        > many are much lower

    -   This model truck has a higher *possible* payload (3000+ lbs!),
        > but unfortunately you have to search really hard to find a
        > version of the truck with the heavy-duty payload option, and I
        > couldn't find it easily, so I went with the "regular payload"
        > version. Still enough to get a camper i'll like, but barely.

        -   Can actually swap out most of the parts from the high
            > payload package, so you can in theory increase the payload
            > capacity. The exception is the frame rails are actually
            > beefier in the heavy duty payload package for this model
            > year; if I'd gotten a 2021+, all the 4x4 8-foot bed frames
            > are the same...

-   Regular unleaded gas is easy to find anywhere and cheap

-   The most powerful engine is also fairly economical at 24mpg highway
    > (unloaded), 18 city, 20/21 average. The V8 or Diesel would have
    > been better for continuous operation if I was constantly climbing
    > mountains fully loaded, although the Diesel is incredibly rare.

    -   Could have gotten a Super Duty (F250/F350) with slightly worse
        > gas mileage (estimates are between 12 and 18 mpg, no official
        > numbers) but some quick math shows that over two decades you
        > save tens of thousands of dollars, enough to buy a replacement
        > truck!

-   36-gallon fuel tank lasts much longer (e.g. offroad, idling)

-   4x4 to go offroad or better traction in bad weather/trails

-   Half-ton truck has a larger stance than midsize trucks making it
    > have slightly better stock clearance, but in reality most midsize
    > trucks can be upgraded to higher clearance

-   Most popular truck: easy to maintain over time, lots of aftermarket
    > support

-   Paid a lot of money (\$29,000, minus the trade-in) but at 54,000
    > miles and in very good condition, it will last longer than a
    > higher-mileage truck in questionable condition. If well taken care
    > of it should retain good value. And it's purty :3
