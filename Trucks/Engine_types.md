# Trucks

## Engine Types

**On electric trucks:** I haven't included much eletric truck research here yet, but consider:

 - They tend to not have great payload or tow ratings (so far)
 - They can lose range with more load, so you won't go as far. They also lose up to
   1/3 of their range in cold weather.
 - Many camp sites don't allow charging at the camp-site hookup. They also only
   offer 120VAC, so you will get about 1 mile per 1.5 hrs charging, if they allow it.

**On hybrid trucks:** Comparable to regular gas trucks, but with decreased payload and
marginally better fuel economy, but more power.

**On LPG trucks:** Not done any research on this.


### Engine impact on Payload

For a specific truck model, the engine choice will usually change the payload capacity.

Heavier engines, OR engines without as much power, can reduce payload capacity.

Different engines also change the axle, transmission, and differential, which all
affect payload capacity.


### Horsepower & Torque

In general, diesels win, but there are exceptions.

- Gas engines lose power by 3-4% per 1,000 ft. elevation. To maintain performance, reduce GVWs and GCWs by 2% per 1,000 ft. elevation starting at the 1,000 ft. elevation point.

- Check the entire torque band rating for a motor. Gas engines' torque can be very low at low RPMs. You may want more low-end torque to haul a camper (for example, if you're parked on a hill, or going up a hill at high elevation).

- Turbos add power at elevation by increasing air density, so a turbo gas or diesel will do much better than a naturally-aspirated equivalent.

### Engine Type Pros/Cons

| Consideration          | Diesel                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Gas                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fuel economy**       | Diesel engines have better fuel economy than gasoline because diesel is more energy-dense (so there's more energy per volume), and diesel engines have higher compression ratios which makes for more efficient extraction of energy. Since they are more fuel efficient, you will therefore travel farther on a tank of diesel than gas. | Gas engines have worse fuel economy than diesels in general, though some newer, smaller engines are much more fuel efficient than in the past. |
| **Fuel prices**        | Diesel fuel prices tend to be more expensive than gasoline, sometimes significantly more expensive. Plus you occasionally need to add diesel exhaust fluid. So you may not save as much money over time as you think.                                                                                                                     | Gasoline fuel prices tend to be lower, depending on the part of the country you're in.                                                         |
| **Longevity**          | Diesel engines tend to last longer than gasoline engines. There's nothing in particular about their design that causes this; they just tend to be built to withstand more abuse, as they are expected to be used for more demanding tasks. A higher-mileage diesel engine generally isn't a concern as it is with gas engines.            | Gas engines don't tend to last as long as diesels, but they can last a long time with proper maintenance.                                      |
| **Power**              | Diesel engines tend to have much more lower-end torque than gasoline engines. This is good for hauling heavy payloads and towing.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Gas engines tend to have much worse low-end torque which can make it challenging to haul heavy loads under certain conditions.                 |
| **Cost**               | Diesel trucks are typically more expensive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Gas trucks are typically less expensive then diesels.                                                                                          |
| **Truck Availability** | Diesel engines are increasingly hard to find in medium- to full-size trucks. However, they are more popular outside the USA.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Gas engines are widely available.                                                                                                              |
| **Fuel Availability**  | In the USA can be harder to find diesel if you are stranded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | In the USA it can be easier to find gasoline than diesel.                                                                                      |
| **Elevation**          | Diesel engines are more efficient at high elevation than naturally-aspirated gasoline engines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Gas engines lose power at high elevation, but a turbocharger can help counteract this.                                                         |
| **Payload**            | Diesel engines tend to be heavier, reducing payload capacity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Gas engines can be lighter, creating more payload capacity. (The highest payload capacity Ford F-150 is a gasoline 3.5L V6 Turbo)              |


### General recommendations

- If cost is no concern, OR you don't want a small truck, OR you need to haul something heavy, AND you want it to work fine at high elevation, get a diesel. More power & low-end torque, lasts longer, better fuel economy, is fine at elevation, and fine in the cold (as long as you maintain the glow plugs and try to use winter fuel when possible).
- If you can't find a diesel, or it doesn't fit your budget or use-case, a turbo gasoline engine is a good all-around option. It won't have good low-end torque but it will probably do well enough.
- If you want a small-ish fuel-efficient truck, go with gas, hybrid or electric.
- If you're going to tour the world with it, you may find diesel fuel (& mechanics/parts) are more widely available.
