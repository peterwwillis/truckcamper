"Pro","Con"
"Diesel engines have better fuel economy than gasoline because diesel is more energy-dense (so there's more energy per volume), and diesel engines have higher compression ratios which makes for more efficient extraction of energy. Since they are more fuel efficient, you will therefore travel farther on a tank of diesel than gas.","Diesel fuel prices tend to be more expensive than gasoline, sometimes significantly more expensive. So you may not save much money over time."
"Diesel engines tend to last longer than gasoline engines. There's nothing in particular about their design that causes this; they just tend to be built to withstand more abuse, as they are expected to be used for more demanding tasks.","[Diesel exhaust fluid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_exhaust_fluid) is an extra expense."
"Diesel engines tend to have much more lower-end torque than gasoline engines. This is very good for hauling heavy payloads and towing.","Diesel trucks are typically more expensive, and are hard to impossible to find for medium- and full-size trucks."
"Diesel engines are more efficient at high elevation than naturally-aspirated gasoline engines.","Diesel engines tend to be heavier, reducing payload capacity."
"Diesel fuel may be easier to find in some countries than gasoline.",""
