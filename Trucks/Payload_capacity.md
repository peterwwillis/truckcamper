# Trucks

## Payload capacity

The payload capacity is how much you can safely carry in/on the truck, including passengers
and gear. Everything you add to the truck, brings down the payload number.

The truck's payload rating determines what camper you can safely carry. **You cannot
increase payload capacity.** Your truck must have a payload rating sufficient for the
camper you want.

Every truck that rolls off the assembly line can have *a different payload* than the last truck. Trucks are ordered with options, and those options change what the truck can safely carry.

A truck brochure may claim *"3,500lbs maximum payload!!!"*, but it may turn out only a few trucks can actually reach that. The individual truck you buy may only have a 1,500lbs payload due to its configuration. Even heavy-duty trucks can have surprisingly small payload ratings due to their configuration.

Therefore: always check the payload of the individual truck. You can do this two ways:

- (Option 1) Open the driver-side door and look at the inside of the door jamb. There should be a sticker that specifically says the payload rating. There are multiple stickers here, so look carefully.

- (Option 2) Bring your truck to a set of truck scales and weigh the truck when empty. Then look up the **gross vehicle weight rating** (**GVWR**) of your particular truck (again, check the driver-side door jamb sticker). Subtract the curb weight from the GVWR, subtract the combined weight of all passengers, and that's your payload rating.

### Weighing the truck

In order to accurately assess where you stand when it comes to payload, you should take your fully loaded truck and camper [to a local](https://www.truckcamperadventure.com/taking-the-cat-scale-truck-camper-challenge/) [*Certified Automated Truck (CAT) Scale*](https://www.truckcamperadventure.com/taking-the-cat-scale-truck-camper-challenge/).

Three figures are provided each time you have your truck and camper weighed: the two axle weights plus the total weight of the rig.

Owners should take their truck to the scale first without the camper, then have their truck and camper weighed together later to determine the actual weight of each (the truck and the camper).

Be mindful that, every time you weigh, you should duplicate important fluid levels like fresh water and diesel/gas when obtaining these numbers.

Campers can be heavier than the weight advertised by the camper company. However, many people who report heavier campers simply haven't determined the correct weight for their individual camper. The camper must be empty of any water or gear. In addition, campers are often modified at the factory with additional options, which increase their weight (similar to trucks), so the true weight should be inquired at time of purchase from a dealer.


### Achieving a payload capacity

If you modify your truck, for example by getting bigger tires, adding more leaf springs, etc, that may change the weight of the truck, which will change your payload capacity.

Reducing weight can increase payload capacity, so choosing lighter-weight parts, or removing unnecessary add-ons, can help increase payload.


#### Wheels & Tires

You can potentially increase payload, up to the capacity of the axle(s), by increasing the wheel and tire load capacity.

If you research the actual GAWRs with the axle manufacturer you'll probably be surprised to learn that you have several hundreds, if not thousands, of additional pounds of cargo carrying capacity (for example: the AAM 11.5 rear axle found on Ram 3500 trucks has a 10,000-pound GAWR rating, 3,000 pounds more than the GAWR given by FCA).

You can tap into this additional cargo carrying capacity by buying better wheels and tires with higher load ratings.

- Light Truck (LT) tires with a load range C, D, or E, typically have a higher weight rating that can help you achieve your maximum payload rating.
- Some aftermarket 10-ply, load range E tires offer a 4,080-pound weight capacity, while others offer an acceptable 3,640-pound capacity.
- Check your wheels' weight ratings. Even if you buy a truck with a Heavy-Duty Payload Package, someone might have changed the wheels out for ones with a lower weight rating.
